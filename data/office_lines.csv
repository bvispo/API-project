152,What is that?,Michael,Season 1,1x1
153,That is my stapler.,Dwight,Season 1,1x1
154,"No, no, no. Do not take it out. You have to eat it out of there, because there are starving people in the world [turns to camera] which I hate, and it is a waste of that kind of food.",Michael,Season 1,1x1

157,It's always you. Are you going to discipline him or not?,Dwight,Season 1,1x1

188,"So have you felt the vibe yet? We work hard, we play hard. Sometimes we play hard when we should be working hard. Right?

Oh, hey do you like The Jamie Kennedy Experiment? Punk'd and all that kind of stuff?",Michael,Season 1,1x1
190,"You are gonna be my accomplice. Just go along with it, OK?",Michael,Season 1,1x1

201,Are you serious?,Pam,Season 1,1x1

205,"[Pam starts crying] You been X'd punk! [Laughing] Surprise! It's a joke. We were joking around. See? OK. He was in on it. He was my accomplice. And it was kind of a morale booster thing.

207,I don't know about that.,Michael,Season 1,1x1

My proudest moment here was not when I increased profits by 17% or when I cut expenses without losing a single employee. No, no, no, no, no. It was a young Guatemalan guy. First job in the country, barely spoke English. He came to me, and said, 'Mr. Scott, would you be the godfather of my child?' Wow. Wow. Didn't work out in the end. We had to let him go. He sucked.",Michael,Season 1,1x1

And we can go back and forth for sometime and uh, then I'll say, How much, how many reams do you want?' And they'll order it and then I'll take care of all the sales.

But if they knew what was lurking on the other side of that fence that furry monster. [imitating monster] 'I'm gonna get you, downsizing.' No. They wouldn't... They'd freak.

It could be behind you or whatever. This is directly in a blind spot, so I'm trained to respond negatively to something right above my head. [new take] This now I have an eye on. You see, it's on my periphery and if I needed to block it, attack it, stop it somehow. [does a martial arts move with his hands] I could come right out. I mean, I know you're doing your job, but...

575,"The most sacred thing I do is care and provide for my workers, my family. I give them money. I give them food. Not directly, but through the money. I heal them.

Yeah, like a specialist.",Michael,Season 1,1x3
577,"I am going to go with the best, Jan. I am going to go with the one with the acupuncture, therapeutic massage, you know, the works.",Michael,Season 1,1x3

581,"Well, I'd recommend it. It's very good.",Michael,Season 1,1x3
583,You gotta crack these things open.,Michael,Season 1,1x3
585,"Well, that is kind of a tough assignment. Um... It won't be popular decision around the old orifice.",Michael,Season 1,1x3
587,"Well, it's a suicide mission, you know.",Michael,Season 1,1x3
589,"There, there...",Michael,Season 1,1x3

601,Gosh.,Jim,Season 1,1x3
602,Yeah!,Michael,Season 1,1x3
603,That is a great offer. Thank you. I really think I should be concentrating on sales.,Jim,Season 1,1x3
604,Really?,Michael,Season 1,1x3
605,"Yeah. I just don't think this is the kind of task, that I... am going to do. You know who would be great for this?",Jim,Season 1,1x3
606,"Any time Michael asks me to do anything, I just tell him that Dwight should do it.",Jim,Season 1,1x3
607,Yes. I can do it. I'm your man.,Dwight,Season 1,1x3
608,"Right now, this is just a job. If I advance any higher in this company then this would be my career. And uh, well, if this were my career, I'd have to throw myself in front of a train.",Jim,Season 1,1x3
609,"OK, first, let's go over some parameters. How many people can I fire?",Dwight,Season 1,1x3
610,"Ah, none. You're picking a health care plan.",Michael,Season 1,1x3
611,"OK, we'll table that for the time being. Two, I'll need an office. I think the conference room should be fine.",Dwight,Season 1,1x3
612,You can use the conference room as a temporary workspace.,Michael,Season 1,1x3

616,Temporary workspace. You can use it.,Michael,Season 1,1x3
617,Thank you.,Dwight,Season 1,1x3
618,"If Dwight fails, then that is strike two, and good for me for, ah, for giving him a second chance. And if he succeeds, then, you know, no one will be prouder than I am. I groomed him. I made him what he is today. Unless he fails, and we've talked about that already.",Michael,Season 1,1x3
619,What did I do? I did my job. I slashed benefits to the bone. I saved this company money. Was I too harsh? Maybe. I don't believe in coddling people.,Dwight,Season 1,1x3
620,"In the wild, there is no health care. In the wild, health care is, 'Ow, I hurt my leg. I can't run. A lion eats me and I'm dead.' Well, I'm not dead. I'm the lion. You're dead.",Dwight,Season 1,1x3
622,"Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.",Pam,Season 1,1x3

634,"Uh, knock, please. Please knock. This is an office.",Dwight,Season 1,1x3
635,It says 'workspace'.,Jim,Season 1,1x3
636,Same thing.,Dwight,Season 1,1x3
637,"If it's the same thing, then why did you write 'workspace'?",Jim,Season 1,1x3
638,"Just knock, Please? As a sign of respect for your superior.",Dwight,Season 1,1x3
639,You are not my superior.,Jim,Season 1,1x3
640,"Oh gee, then why do I have an office?",Dwight,Season 1,1x3
641,I thought it was a workspace?,Jim,Season 1,1x3
642,OK. Dwight. Are you really in charge of picking the health care plan?,Pam,Season 1,1x3
643,Yes. And my decision in final.,Dwight,Season 1,1x3
644,This is a ridiculously awful plan. Because you cut everything.,Pam,Season 1,1x3
645,"Aww, times are tough, Pam. Deal with it.",Dwight,Season 1,1x3
646,"You cut more than you had to, didn't you?",Jim,Season 1,1x3
647,Sure.,Dwight,Season 1,1x3
648,"Well, why did you do that? You work here, don't you want good insurance?",Jim,Season 1,1x3
649,Don't need it. Never been sick. Perfect immune system.,Dwight,Season 1,1x3
650,"OK, well, if you've never been sick, then you don't have any antibodies.",Jim,Season 1,1x3
651,"I don't need them. Superior genes. I'm a Schrute. And superior brain power. Through concentration, I can raise and lower my cholesterol at will.",Dwight,Season 1,1x3
652,Why would you want to raise your cholesterol?,Pam,Season 1,1x3
653,So I can lower it.,Dwight,Season 1,1x3

661,Dwight's health care memo. I told you about it.,Pam,Season 1,1x3

666,"Cuts? What? Wow, Dwight, did you make cuts?",Michael,Season 1,1x3
667,"Yeah, you said...",Dwight,Season 1,1x3
668,"No, no , no, you know what? I said nothing specific because I was so busy. Why don't you go in there and find these people a plan that will work for them? OK?",Michael,Season 1,1x3
669,I can handle that.,Dwight,Season 1,1x3
670,"OK? All right. Do we feel good? All right. Good. Plus, there's some other good news. Today, at the end of the day, I will have, for all of you, a big surprise. OK? So hang in there, and I will see you at the end of the day. Right?",Michael,Season 1,1x3
677,"Do I know what the surprise is? Hell no! It doesn't matter. The point is, they're not unhappy anymore. They're out there thinking, 'Wow, my boss really cares about me. He has a surprise. He's cool. I... what a great guy. I love him. I...",Michael,Season 1,1x3
678,"OK, everyone. Gather round. Step forward. It has been brought to my attention that some of you are unhappy with my plan. So what I'd like you to do is to fill this out and write down any diseases you have that you might want covered and I'll see what I can do.",Dwight,Season 1,1x3
679,"OK, you know what Dwight? We can't write our diseases down for you because that's confidential.",Jim,Season 1,1x3
680,"OK, well, I didn't say to write your name down, did I? Fill it out, leave it anonymous. Or, don't write any disease down at all and it won't be covered. Sound fair? Good. I'll be in my office.",Dwight,Season 1,1x3
681,Workspace.,Jim,Season 1,1x3
682,You know what? Come with me. We are going on a little mission. Operation Surprise.,Michael,Season 1,1x3

684,"Um, headed out. Part of my busy day, you know. Meetings. [Giggles] Couldn't find the knob.",Michael,Season 1,1x3
685,"So, basically, I want to do something nice for my employees. Atlantic City, OK? They have this thing where they send a bus, right, for free. Picks everybody up, you head down there, get to the hotel, room is comped, they give you a pile of chips, and your food, everything just kind of all-inclusive, free kind of weekend.",Michael,Season 1,1x3
687,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. I did, so...",Michael,Season 1,1x3
688,Wait. What are you writing? Don't write Ebola or mad cow disease. Right? 'Cause I'm suffering from both.,Jim,Season 1,1x3
689,I'm inventing new diseases.,Pam,Season 1,1x3
690,"Oh, great.",Jim,Season 1,1x3
691,"So, let's say my teeth turn to liquid and then, they drip down the back of my throat. What would you call that?",Pam,Season 1,1x3
692,I thought you said you were inventing diseases? That's spontaneous dental hydroplosion.,Jim,Season 1,1x3
693,Nice.,Pam,Season 1,1x3
694,Thank you.,Jim,Season 1,1x3
695,"[on his cell phone] Calling you to ask you a little favoroonie my friend. Um, trying to give the troops around here a little bit of a boost. And I was thinking that maybe we could take them down to take a spin on your big ride.",Michael,Season 1,1x3
697,Its says here that it's a 300ft drop.,Michael,Season 1,1x3
699,So it's not a free fall?,Michael,Season 1,1x3
701,"Uh, all right. Well, once you get down into the mine, what... you got laser tag or something?",Michael,Season 1,1x3
702,"OK, so I don't know what the surprise is. Am I worried? No. No way. See, I thrive on this. This is my world. This is improv. This is Whose Line is it Anyway?",Michael,Season 1,1x3
703,Damnit! Damnit Jim!,Dwight,Season 1,1x3
704,"All right, who did this? I'm not mad. I just want to know who did it so I can punish them.",Dwight,Season 1,1x3
705,What are you talking about?,Jim,Season 1,1x3
706,"Uh, someone forged, uh, medical information and that is a felony.",Dwight,Season 1,1x3
707,"OK, whoa. 'Cause that is a pretty intense accusation. How do you know that they're fake?",Jim,Season 1,1x3
708,"Uh, leprosy? Flesh eating bacteria. Hot-dog fingers. Government-created killer nanorobot infection.",Dwight,Season 1,1x3
709,"You did this, didn't you?",Dwight,Season 1,1x3
710,Absolutely not.,Jim,Season 1,1x3
711,Yes you did.,Dwight,Season 1,1x3
712,No I didn't.,Jim,Season 1,1x3

714,Killer nanorobots?,Jim,Season 1,1x3
715,It's an epidemic.,Pam,Season 1,1x3
716,"The problem, Jim, is that people who are really suffering from a medical condition won't receive the care they need, because someone in this office is coming up with all this ridiculous stuff. [reads off of paper] 'Count Choculitis'",Dwight,Season 1,1x3
717,Sounds tough.,Jim,Season 1,1x3
718,Why did you write that down Jim? Is it because you know I love Count Chocula?,Dwight,Season 1,1x3
719,Do you?,Jim,Season 1,1x3
720,I think you need to confess...,Dwight,Season 1,1x3
721,Mmm hmm.,Jim,Season 1,1x3

761,Well...,Dwight,Season 1,1x3
763,He is not here right now. He put me in charge of the office.,Dwight,Season 1,1x3
765,"That's not entirely true, because he put me in charge of picking the health care plan.",Dwight,Season 1,1x3

776,There you go.,Michael,Season 1,1x3

779,Michael. Michael?,Dwight,Season 1,1x3
780,"[under his breath] Oh, Christ.",Michael,Season 1,1x3
781,"I tried being rational, OK? And what happened? The employees went crazy, I got no help from corporate. That leaves me with no options.",Dwight,Season 1,1x3
782,"I'm now going to read out loud your submitted medical conditions. When you hear yours read, please raise your hand to indicate that it is real. If you do not raise your hand, it will not be covered.",Dwight,Season 1,1x3

801,I most certainly did not.,Dwight,Season 1,1x3
802,"Oh come on! That's horrible! Aaah... Thanks, Dwight, for a crappy plan. Ah, Damn! Oh, mmm, I wish I had time to change it, but Jan needs it by five, and... what time is it, what time is it?

817,"You know when ever a worker is promoted above their peers there's always going to be a little bit of jealousy. Uh, it's natural. And that's going to lead to goofing off and that's okay that's fine. As long as they are willing to suffer the consequences.",Dwight,Season 1,1x3
819,"Sorry, too busy can't even come to the door.",Michael,Season 1,1x3
821,"Yeah, no... [hurries to get up from chair]",Michael,Season 1,1x3

828,Mmm hmm.,Pam,Season 1,1x3
829,"I really heard him on that. This one's interesting I'm not really sure what he meant by this. Um, 'Dwight Schrute Privates.' Tough to say.",Jim,Season 1,1x3

861,In case I get sick.,Pam,Season 1,1x3
862,"Why don't you just go ahead and use Roy's health care plan, huh?",Dwight,Season 1,1x3
863,Because we're not married.,Pam,Season 1,1x3

[as Robin Williams] 'That's Good morning, Vietnam!' Well, hello to you. You know it would be... God. And you know what, sometimes when I'm watching somebody like um, like Jay Leno. He'll be half way through his step [snaps his fingers] And I will already be laughing at the punch line. He hasn't even gotten to it. He doesn't even know what it is it. So it's fun, you know it's fun having a mind that works like that. That is just a few steps ahead of... comedically ahead of like what's going on. Like I'll watch T.V. and I'll be watching a show and I will think, oh, I know someone's gonna walk in here right now and say something funny. And then they do. Or, um, I know they'll be like oh boy that person deserved to be slammed down. There's going to be some sort of insult. And there is. You know, there's like, 'Oh you're... God your butt is fat.' And I knew it. I know it's like I knew they were going to say that. I knew they were gonna go there. Don't go there. Um, but other...

901,"Mmm, mm, mm. Maybe.",Michael,Season 1,1x4
902,"It looks like there's gonna be downsizing. And it's part of my job, but... blah! I hate it. I think the main difference between me and Donald Trump is that, uh, I get no pleasure out of saying the words, 'You're fired.' [as Donald Trump] 'You're foir-ed. Uh, you're foir-ed.' It just makes people sad, and an office can't function that way. No way. [as Donald Trump] 'You're foir-ed.'  I think if I had a catchphrase it would be, 'You're hired, and you can work here as long as you want.' But that's unrealistic, so...",Michael,Season 1,1x4

[laughs] Um, let's see. Jim, Jim wrote, 'Meredith, I heard you're turning 46, but, come on, you're an accountant. Just fudge the numbers.' Not bad, pretty funny, I don't appreciate condoning corporate fraud though. Uh, here's the thing. Whatever I write here has to be really, really funny. Because people out there are expecting it. I've already set the bar really high. And they're all worried about their jobs, you know. It's kinda dark out there. Can you imagine if I wrote something like, uh, 'Oh, Meredith. Happy Birthday.

[tears open envelope and pulls out card] 'Name three businesses that have a better health care plans than Dunder Mifflin.'  Here's the problem.

2580,"When I said before that I was king of forwards, you got to understand that I don't come up with this stuff. I just forward it along. You wouldn't arrest a guy who's just delivering drugs from one guy to another.",Michael,Season 2,2x2

2706,"And now Roy and Pam are dead, and we have your stupid rules to blame, Toby.",Michael,Season 2,2x2
2707,"Toby actually gets alimony from his ex-wife because she makes more, so that's kind of embarrassing. Not that I'd mind, but it would never happen to me because I would make the marriage work. People seem to like him because they think he's one of us, but he's not. He's this weird loner who just tells people, 'Don't do this, don't do that. Hire this person for this reason.' I would complain about him, but who would I go to, to complain about Toby? Toby. Bias. And what does he do about that? Nothing. Because he's Toby. What kind of name is that? It's almost a girl's name. I think I've known more girls named Toby than guys. He just kind of makes my skin crawl a little bit. Toby is the devil. Toby's the devil.",Michael,Season 2,2x2

2714,Yeah. I realize that might be harassment.,Pam,Season 2,2x2

2717,Okay. [IM chiming] [laughing],Jim,Season 2,2x2

2720,"Yummy, yummy. Thank you, Ryan.",Michael,Season 2,2x3
2722,"Um. The sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit. But thank you. And why don't you take a couple hours. The office is yours. 'Home Alone,' 'Risky Business.' Take your pants off, run around. Whatever you gotta do.",Michael,Season 2,2x3

3446,That is so cool.,Dwight,Season 2,2x4
3447,Mmm-hmm.,Michael,Season 2,2x4

3454,You could ask for an extension.,Dwight,Season 2,2x4
3455,I'm not asking the temp for an extension unless I really need it.,Michael,Season 2,2x4
3456,"I know Michael's every move. It's not something you can just pick up. I could write a book about him. Literally. I started once, but Michael made me stop.",Dwight,Season 2,2x4
3457,"Hey, how's it going, man?",Dwight,Season 2,2x4
3459,"Oh, nothing much. What's up with you?",Dwight,Season 2,2x4
3461,"Good. Good, I'm good, too. How's it cracking?",Dwight,Season 2,2x4

3465,I'll make you two tapes.,Dwight,Season 2,2x4

3470,"I like fire drills. You know what's the greatest? Like, when you were in school and the teacher would let you have class outside.",Pam,Season 2,2x4
3471,"Oh, the best.",Jim,Season 2,2x4
3472,"Yeah, it was great because it was like you're supposed to be working, but nothing ever gets done.",Pam,Season 2,2x4

3476,You're not stuck.,Pam,Season 2,2x4
3478,"Yes, yes, I ran out first. A captain is always the first one on the ship and the last one off the ship. And this parking lot is our ship when the building is on fire. So, I ran out onto the ship.",Michael,Season 2,2x4

3494,"When I was Ryan's age, I worked at Arby's and then I worked selling cutlery for a while. Cutlery that could decimate a penny, I kid you not. There were these shears that could cut straight through a penny. So I have life experience and work experience that Ryan doesn't, and will never have.",Michael,Season 2,2x4
3495,And then you go to school for three years.,Jim,Season 2,2x4

3505,"If I could change the life of one person, just one person. I... Actually, that's shooting kind of low. I already did that when I was born. I changed two people's lives. Mom and Dad. Um, if I could change the lives of 5,000 people... 10,000. No, five. I'd be satisfied with 5,000. I... 10,000 though, that'd be something. Wow, 10,000 people. Because, you know what?

3508,Ohh... OK.,Michael,Season 2,2x5
3509,"I know why she's calling. It's the end of the month, and I was supposed to let somebody go by the end of the month.  And somehow I'm supposed to put on a costume and smile. [dials a number on his speaker phone] Okay.",Michael,Season 2,2x5
3511,"Hey, Sherri. Michael Scott returning.",Michael,Season 2,2x5

3515,I don't know... yet. I will have to call her back.,Michael,Season 2,2x5
3517,Okay... Sherri?,Michael,Season 2,2x5

3529,Bye.,Michael,Season 2,2x5

3539,"Um, Pam, I have to let somebody go today. This is, uh, the hardest thing I've ever had to do.",Michael,Season 2,2x5
3540,Why did you put it off until Halloween?,Pam,Season 2,2x5
3541,Because it's very scary stuff.,Michael,Season 2,2x5
3542,I think it's gonna put a damper on the party a little.,Pam,Season 2,2x5
3543,You're worried about the party? There's a man's life at stake here.,Michael,Season 2,2x5
3544,So it's a man?,Pam,Season 2,2x5
3545,"No. Or a woman. A human life. If you had to guess, who it would be based on their job performance... and who you think deserved to be fired - who would that be?",Michael,Season 2,2x5
3546,I just answer the phone.,Pam,Season 2,2x5
3547,And... sometimes you just let it go to voicemail.,Michael,Season 2,2x5
3548,You're costume is fantastic! [laughs],Pam,Season 2,2x5
3549,"I know. I sent away for it in July from a catalog. [bobs his head around, causing the costume head to jiggle around]",Michael,Season 2,2x5

3556,"Yeah, well look... [pulls his hood over his head and pops up his light saber] What about me?",Dwight,Season 2,2x5
3558,I am a Sith Lord. [looks at Jim] Oh big deal. Three round pieces of paper taped to a shirt. This cost me 129 dollars.,Dwight,Season 2,2x5
3560,Hey.,Michael,Season 2,2x5
3562,You guys excited about the party?,Michael,Season 2,2x5
3564,It's gonna be fun.,Michael,Season 2,2x5
3567,"[looks to Oscar] Oh, boy... look at you! Haha. Showing your colors. Bet you wish you wore a dress every day.",Michael,Season 2,2x5
3569,All good. Happy Halloween. What happened to all those spooky decorations that we had? The cobwebs and such?,Michael,Season 2,2x5
3571,"Well, you know what? Go buy some more. I'll approve the overages. Sound good?",Michael,Season 2,2x5
3573,"Good.  Oh, yeah, also about budget stuff. Um, I'm  going to need you to find, like a, a full employee salary, plus benefits, like fifty grand. I'm going to need you to find 50 grand in the numbers.",Michael,Season 2,2x5
3575,"Well, that's not what I'm saying. Just, you know, find it. Pretend that your jobs depend on it.",Michael,Season 2,2x5
3576,"Mmm-hm-hmm. Interesting take on Dorothy. I love it. Hey, you know what would even be better? Soccer ball and cleats.",Michael,Season 2,2x5
3578,Bend It Like Beckham.',Michael,Season 2,2x5

3583,"Wait, what are you again? Oh, right... Three-hole PUNCH! [punches Jim in the chest and cracks up laughing]",Dwight,Season 2,2x5
3584,"Okay, greatest strength.",Pam,Season 2,2x5
3585,"Okay, okay...",Jim,Season 2,2x5
3586,A dog-like obedience to authority,Pam,Season 2,2x5
3587,Nice.,Jim,Season 2,2x5
3588,But that doesn't sound good.,Pam,Season 2,2x5
3589,"Okay, okay. Um, how 'bout, the ultimate team player? [Pam laughs and types]",Jim,Season 2,2x5
3590,"Dwight is... special. But, I don't believe that his talents are being used in this office. So Pam and I have put his resume on Monster.com, Google, Craig's List. We're really interested most in jobs that take Dwight out of state. Um, preferably Alaska... or India.",Jim,Season 2,2x5
3591,He's a gun nut.,Pam,Season 2,2x5
3592,Um. He sticks to his guns.,Jim,Season 2,2x5

3604,Eh.,Michael,Season 2,2x5
3605,Stanley. Pam. Oscar. Meredith. Kevin. Angela.,Dwight,Season 2,2x5
3606,It's not a popularity contest. Although it does make sense to fire the least popular because it has the least effect on morale.,Michael,Season 2,2x5
3607,One of the warehouse guys.,Dwight,Season 2,2x5
3608,"[turns to the fake head, listening] What? There was someone left off that list? Who?",Michael,Season 2,2x5

3611,"No, Michael.",Dwight,Season 2,2x5
3612,"Yeah, that's actually a really good idea.",Michael,Season 2,2x5
3613,"No, not me.",Dwight,Season 2,2x5
3614,Yeah... I could.,Michael,Season 2,2x5
3615,Not Dwight.,Dwight,Season 2,2x5
3616,I'm not saying that's what he said.,Michael,Season 2,2x5
3617,I know that's what he said.,Dwight,Season 2,2x5
3618,[listening to his head] What?,Michael,Season 2,2x5
3619,"Tell him, not Dwight.",Dwight,Season 2,2x5
3620,That is not a very nice thing to say about him.,Michael,Season 2,2x5
3621,Tell him to stop.,Dwight,Season 2,2x5
3622,Are you kidding?,Michael,Season 2,2x5
3623,"Quiet, you.",Dwight,Season 2,2x5
3624,I agree. He'd land on his feet.,Michael,Season 2,2x5

3627,"No, I made brownies.",Pam,Season 2,2x5
3629,... What?,Pam,Season 2,2x5
3631,I made brownies.,Pam,Season 2,2x5
3633,I'm guessing Angela's the one in the neighborhood who gives the trick-or-treaters some toothbrushes. Pennies. Walnuts.,Pam,Season 2,2x5
3634,"[on phone] Dunder-Mifflin. This is Pam. [listens] Uh, yeah. [snaps her fingers in the air, getting Jim's attention] Just one second. I will, uh, transfer you to our manager, Michael Scott.",Pam,Season 2,2x5
3635,"Um... Whoa. [picks up ringing phone][in managerial voice] Michael Scott here. Yes, I am regional manager of this orifice. Mmm hmm. Dwight Schrute is amazing. Yeah. No, he is actually the single greatest employee of his generation. Mm  hmm. You know what? I'm gonna tell you what. You hire Dwight K. Schrute, and if he does not meet, nay, exceed every one of your wildest expectations, well then, you can hold me, Michael Gary Scott, personally and financially responsible. Okay. Okay. Okay-kay-kay-kay-kay. Okay.",Jim,Season 2,2x5

3642,So. How did it go with Stanley? How... how'd he take it?,Michael,Season 2,2x5
3643,He wouldn't listen to me,Dwight,Season 2,2x5

3647,"[whispering on the phone] Cumberland Mills?! And how did you get my resume? Oh no, no. I'm very flattered. Don't get me wrong. I'm just not sure that it's my official resume or if it's something that maybe a satisfied customer posted online. What does it say under martial arts training? Oh. Okay, I'm gonna have to supplement that. Could I have your fax number?",Dwight,Season 2,2x5
3648,"Would I ever leave this company? Look, I'm all about loyalty. In fact, I feel like part of what I'm getting paid for here is my loyalty. But, if there were somewhere else that valued that loyalty more highly, I'm going wherever they value loyalty the most.",Dwight,Season 2,2x5
3652,"[on the phone] So you got the fax? So why didn't you add it to the res... ? What do you mean? Of course martial arts training is relevant. Oh, excuse me! I know about a billion Asians that would beg to differ. Uh, yeah, I get a little frustrated when I'm dealing with incompetence. Well, you know what? You can go to hell, too. And I will see you there... burning. Fine! Okay... oh wait! So you'll let me know when you've made a decis... [stops and hangs up phone.]",Dwight,Season 2,2x5
3653,"Jim is really talented. And he should be the one who's getting a better job offer. Like, for real.",Pam,Season 2,2x5
3654,"Don't take this the wrong way, but... you should go for that job.",Pam,Season 2,2x5
3655,Um... it's in Maryland.,Jim,Season 2,2x5
3656,"Yeah, but I mean, look at the salary. And it's definitely a step up. And a challenge.",Pam,Season 2,2x5
3657,Yeah.  Yeah. You know what? Maybe... maybe I will. [starts walking away],Jim,Season 2,2x5
3658,Jim...,Pam,Season 2,2x5
3659,"This is called leveraging an offer. [walks into Michael's office] Michael, can I talk to you for a moment?",Dwight,Season 2,2x5
3660,"Oh, God.",Michael,Season 2,2x5
3661,"I just thought you should know that I was just offered a job with better pay, better benefits and a better title at Cumberland Mills.",Dwight,Season 2,2x5
3662,Fantastic!,Michael,Season 2,2x5
3663,And I turned it down.,Dwight,Season 2,2x5
3664,What?! That would've solved all my problems.,Michael,Season 2,2x5
3665,Out of loyalty to this company...,Dwight,Season 2,2x5
3666,"Oh, you idiot.",Michael,Season 2,2x5
3667,... so I was hoping to be made Assistant Regional Manager officially.,Dwight,Season 2,2x5
3668,"If you left, I wouldn't have to fire anybody.",Michael,Season 2,2x5
3669,But then you wouldn't have me here.,Dwight,Season 2,2x5

3671,It's in Maryland.,Dwight,Season 2,2x5
3672,You can call. Can you call 'em?,Michael,Season 2,2x5

3674,Wohahah! Why are you torturing me?! God.,Michael,Season 2,2x5
3675,"Honestly, I don't think Michael has the slightest clue of who he's gonna  fire. I think he keeps hoping that someone's going to volunteer. Uh, or be run over by a bus before the deadline. But in the end, really, what's going to happen is it's gonna be the first person to give him a dirty look in the hall. And therein lies the true essence of his charisma.",Jim,Season 2,2x5
3676,[clearing his throat and interrupting Jim's talking head] Can I speak to you a minute?,Michael,Season 2,2x5

3689,"Yes, that's a good idea.",Michael,Season 2,2x5
3690,"Alright. [they stand up] Excuse me.[They sit down] I'm really sorry, but I have to let you go. And it's purely budgetary. It's not personal...",Jim,Season 2,2x5
3691,Aaaahh! I'm gonna kill myself!,Michael,Season 2,2x5
3692,Wow.,Jim,Season 2,2x5
3693,"I'm going to kill myself, and it's your fault!",Michael,Season 2,2x5

3705,"Get off, get off. No, no. OK.. just get off.[sits back down in his chair and waves Jim off.] Just, just... yeah.",Michael,Season 2,2x5
3706,What happened?,Pam,Season 2,2x5

3710,"Uh, hey... Creed?",Michael,Season 2,2x5
3712,Could I talk to you for a second?,Michael,Season 2,2x5

3721,I think you're right.,Michael,Season 2,2x5
3723,"No, of course  you can't go. We haven't even started this horrible process of... okay, Creed. I need to let somebody go today. They told me I need to let somebody go. And as much as I think you're a great guy, and I like you, you're... you're, goodbye.",Michael,Season 2,2x5
3725,Hmm?,Michael,Season 2,2x5

3764,[motions for her to follow him] Come on.,Jim,Season 2,2x5
3765,"That's just a figure of speech, you know? Blow your brains out? Come on. All it really means is that we're friends. Who else is she gonna talk to if I'm gone, right? I mean, if she left, I wouldn't blow my brains out. Of course, I would take that job in Maryland. Because it's double the pay, and soft shell crab just happens to be my favorite food.",Jim,Season 2,2x5
3766,"I  love Halloween. You know, it's just, it's just fun. Every year, it's just fun. Last Halloween I came as Janet Jackson's boob. It was topical. People got a... a big kick out of it. The year before that, I came as Monica Lewinsky, and I wore a stained dress. The year before that, I also came as Monica Lewinsky. And before that, I was O.J. It was pretty funny. Oh, I wish you were here last year.",Michael,Season 2,2x5

3785,What? What?,Michael,Season 2,2x5

3797,You guys...,Michael,Season 2,2x5

3802,"I don't know. Hey, are you on our payroll or are you employed by the building?",Michael,Season 2,2x5
3804,"Oh, shoot. Okay, well, just have your pepper spray ready.",Michael,Season 2,2x5

3807,"I have a proposal, everybody. Listen up. Now, Corporate has been really breathing down my neck to make some pay cuts, but I refuse to fire anyone. So, I was thinking that maybe all of you would take a 10% pay cut and that would save the money. Yeah?",Michael,Season 2,2x5
3809,"Okay, great. Fine. Well, then, if anyone is annoyed later at what goes down, you know who to blame. Stanley. Not the guy who was trying to be creative. [turns around to find Toby standing behind him]",Michael,Season 2,2x5

3832,"Oh, here we go. This... um, here's the deal.",Michael,Season 2,2x5
3833,"Yes. Actually, I have. I have been on a hunting trip. I shot a deer in the leg. I had to... I had to hit him, I had to hit him with a shovel for about an hour, so he... That's good eating, though. Venison's very gamey. It's hard to watch, though. It's hard to... It's hard to hit another living thing in the face with a shovel for about an hour. That... I haven't been hunting since then. I, I... 'Cause that's, you know, where's the joy in that? Where's the... There's no sport, really. Especially when you're the one with the shovel. And they're the one just lying there. Um... I would have rather hit it with my car or something and just... I was just smacking the hell out of that thing. That was a mess. And we just left him there. I didn't eat it. I didn't want to eat that. That guy. Why do you ask?",Michael,Season 2,2x5

3847,[talking over Jan] You're glad?,Michael,Season 2,2x5

3892,Ok.,Jim,Season 2,2x6
3893,"I am a practitioner of Goju Ru Karate, here in Scranton. My Sensei, Ira, recently promoted me to purple belt, and gave me the duties of a Sempai. Not that a lot of people here in America know what a Sempai is, but it is equally as respected as a Sensei.",Dwight,Season 2,2x6

3910,"Is it a priority? Oh I don't know, um, what if there is a tornado, Pam? People's legs are crushed under rubble. 'Please, would you be so kind as to call my wife? No, I can't because we don't have any emergency contact information because Pam said it wasn't a priority.' Think. Think with your head, Pam. Ok, well. She walks out.

4167,"Do you have, do you have anything in, like, black?",Michael,Season 2,2x6
4171,Alyssa? I guess she's technically the senpai. But nobody really respects her. The only reason she got into regionals was because her competition was a bunch of 13-year-old girls. Put me in that division. Let's see how she does.,Dwight,Season 2,2x6

4184,"For the record, let me just say, Michael Scott has no honor. If he lived in Japan, he would be an outcast. Well, that's not totally true, 'cause Asians worship chest hair.

4232,"No, no.  That would not be efficient.  Actually, they just don't get very much work done when I'm not here.  [Jan stares at Michael] That's not true.  I know how to delegate, and they do more work done when I'm not here.  Not more.  The same amount of work is done, whether I am here or not. [another Jan stare]  Hey, everybody, listen up.

And, um, what you do, you don't just have the egg yolks, it's not like a Rocky thing.  You do like hard boiled eggs and I got one a those melon ballers [shot of Michael peeling boiled egg] and I, it's just like a little ice cream scoop, and I just scoop out the middle of the egg and just pop it in my mouth.  I don't even, I don't even use a plate anymore.  Uh, the first couple weeks I did, but you know what, boom, I keep a melon baller in my desk so if I have a hard boiled egg [Jenna breaks as Pam and laughs] I know, I know!  But you know what?  It's perfect.  I know it sounds ridiculous, it sounds ridiculous, but you know what?  Dr. David Friendly, he came up with this thing.

Number one: 'What should we do to prepare for Y2K?'",Michael,Season 2,2x8

4669,"Was I, Creed?!  Ok, well, you know what? I am implying is that when we're on an elevator together, I should maybe take the stairs, because talk about stank.  Not that I would ever say something like that in public, and I never have, and I never will. I just think it's something that we should all be aware of.  Ok?

4705,I am ready for my performance review.,Dwight,Season 2,2x8
4706,"Ok, great.  Your performance has been adequate.  You may leave; goodbye.",Michael,Season 2,2x8

4709,"Uh, wait, I would like to discuss my raise?",Dwight,Season 2,2x8
4710,Why on earth would we give you a raise?,Michael,Season 2,2x8
4711,"That is an excellent question. Thank you for asking.  Let me bring up one word: dedication. [points to graphs] I have never been late.  Also, I have never missed a day due to illness. [Michael sighs] Even when I had walking pneumonia.  I even come in on holidays.",Dwight,Season 2,2x8
4712,You do?  How do you get in?,Michael,Season 2,2x8
4713,I have a copy of your key.,Dwight,Season 2,2x8
4715,That is a serious offense. Very serious.  As is toying with a man's heart.,Michael,Season 2,2x8
4717,I'd also further like to talk about my merits in the workplace.,Dwight,Season 2,2x8
4718,"Ok, third wheel, why don't you do that?",Michael,Season 2,2x8
4719,"For instance, the time I brought in deer jerky for the whole office.",Dwight,Season 2,2x8
4720,"That was deer!? Gross, oh!",Michael,Season 2,2x8
4721,You liked it!,Dwight,Season 2,2x8
4722,"Oh, did not!",Michael,Season 2,2x8
4723,"Jan, have you ever had deer?",Dwight,Season 2,2x8
4725,"It's a delicacy.  And you know what?  It's an aphrodisiac.  So when we're done here, you guys could go over to The Antler Lodge, sample some deer and talk about my raise.",Dwight,Season 2,2x8
4726,"What do you say, Jan?",Michael,Season 2,2x8
4728,"Ok. You just, uh, clear your head.",Michael,Season 2,2x8
4731,"And in conclusion, I think that Lex Luthor said it best when he said 'Dad, you have no idea what I'm capable of'.",Dwight,Season 2,2x8
4732,That's from Superman?,Michael,Season 2,2x8
4733,"Smallville.  And that is why, I feel, that I deserve this raise.",Dwight,Season 2,2x8

4737,"Um, you don't, I don't think, come all the way back, you know.  Especially working together.",Jim,Season 2,2x8
4738,"No, I mean doing that with Michael. How do you come back from that?",Pam,Season 2,2x8
4739,Oh-,Jim,Season 2,2x8

4743,Wait.,Michael,Season 2,2x8
4745,"Wait, wait, wait, come, I just, I just wanna know why?",Michael,Season 2,2x8
4747,"Ok, so you're saying that there is a different time or place?",Michael,Season 2,2x8
4749,"Well, ok, well never as in 'never ever ever', or never as in there's still a chance?",Michael,Season 2,2x8
4751,"I just want to know, from the horse's mouth, what is the dealio?",Michael,Season 2,2x8

4759,"No, I wasn't, I didn't cry-",Michael,Season 2,2x8
4761,So my looks have nothing to do with it?,Michael,Season 2,2x8
4763,Jan is not in a place where she feels she can have a relationship right now.  And it doesn't matter how great a guy I am.  And that is all I needed; I'm good.  I can go home now.,Michael,Season 2,2x8
4764,"Hey, it's 12:20; where the hell's Dwight?",Michael,Season 2,2x8

4778,Yes.,Jim,Season 2,2x8
4779,"No, you don't.",Dwight,Season 2,2x8
4780,Then why the question?,Jim,Season 2,2x8
4781,"This is a visual aid for my performance review. Budget is tight, and if anyone is getting a raise, it is gonna be a fight to the death. And I intend on winning that fight. 'Dwight: determined, worker, intense, good worker, hard worker, terrific. Dwight.'",Dwight,Season 2,2x8
4782,"I have one, too. Jim. Jim, Is Jim. My name is Jim.",Jim,Season 2,2x8

4788,I'll use that.,Jim,Season 2,2x8
4790,All right.,Michael,Season 2,2x8
4792,Yup.,Michael,Season 2,2x8
4794,Absolutely.,Michael,Season 2,2x8
4795,"I am not going to discuss anything outside of Dunder Mifflin business, period.' Okay. Now, why would Jan say she only wants to talk business and then make it clear that she is on her period? God, I don't understand women. How about a clear signal, right? Is that too much to ask?",Michael,Season 2,2x8
4796,"So, that's... It's great.",Jim,Season 2,2x8

4813,Yes.,Michael,Season 2,2x8

[groans]",Dwight,Season 2,2x8
4874,"Yeah, that got a little out of control. Jan's taking a break, which is fine. I'm doing the same, just chilling. Getting my mind off of us. She's right. I need to be more professional at the office. When I'm at work, I need to focus on work. I should call her ex-husband.",Michael,Season 2,2x8

I was wondering if I could ask a personal question about her. Mmm-hmm. Okay, well, could I ask anyway? Uh-huh. Well, I'm just gonna ask. When you guys were dating was she sort of easy to get and then really hard to get?",Michael,Season 2,2x8
4876,"Yeah, that Gould is a real interesting guy, a gem. I can see why he and Jan are no longer together. If my conversation with him is any measure of their relationship, he was verbally abusive, he was curt. He was... He had an inability to communicate, shall I say? He was emotionally unavailable. I don't know how she dealt with that as long as she did.",Michael,Season 2,2x8

4896,"What is an office? Is it a group of people? Maybe. Is it an idea? Of course, yes. Is it a living organism? Exactly, yes. And any single cell organism has to have a spine, and that's me. But the spine is always controlled by a brain, and that is Jan. But the brain needs a heart, and that is me again. So ironic. You know what? The heart is smarter than the brain. But the brain is so effing hot.",Michael,Season 2,2x8

And it's nothing personal, I just think that if he were there, people wouldn't be able to relax, and you know, have fun, and my roommate wants to meet everybody.

5366,"Well, there's a $20 limit, right? So .. ?",Jim,Season 2,2x10
5367,Yeah. I wanted this party to be really special so I sorta went above and beyond.,Michael,Season 2,2x10
5368,"That's great. Well don't tell me who it is, cause I can ..",Jim,Season 2,2x10
5369,It was Ryan. Yeah. I have Ryan.,Michael,Season 2,2x10
5370,"Gather round. Secret Santa, let's go. Let's go. Come on. Stanley, no, I'm going to handle the cord. Okay, safety reasons.",Dwight,Season 2,2x10
5372,I want to do it.,Dwight,Season 2,2x10
5373,"All right, let's count it down, like Rockefeller Center. Ready?",Michael,Season 2,2x10
5375,Not great.,Michael,Season 2,2x10
5377,I think the tree looks nice.,Pam,Season 2,2x10
5378,"Hey, I could get some flares from my car.",Dwight,Season 2,2x10
5379,"No, no. Shake it off, everybody. Just, let's do Secret Santa.",Michael,Season 2,2x10
5380,"Presents are the best way to show someone how much you care. It's like this tangible thing that you can point to and say, 'Hey, man, I love you this many dollars worth.'",Michael,Season 2,2x10
5381,"First present, Oscar.",Dwight,Season 2,2x10
5385,Okay. Okay. That's enough. Let's keep it moving on. Jim.,Dwight,Season 2,2x10
5386,"Oh, cool. [opens his plastic bag]",Jim,Season 2,2x10
5388,Great. Where did you get it?,Jim,Season 2,2x10
5390,"He obviously forgot to get me something, and then he went in his closet and dug out this little number [holds up way-too-short sleeves] and then threw it in a bag.",Jim,Season 2,2x10
5392,Pam.,Dwight,Season 2,2x10
5393,"[opens up her present] Oh, my god! Thank you very much, Santa, whoever you are. It's awesome.",Pam,Season 2,2x10
5394,There's a little more to it.,Jim,Season 2,2x10
5395,"All right, next. Ryan. [tosses present]",Dwight,Season 2,2x10
5396,"No, don't!",Michael,Season 2,2x10
5398,"Whoa. Wow. Jeez. Somebody really got carried away with the spirit of Christmas. That was me, I got a little carried away.",Michael,Season 2,2x10
5400,You don't know that.,Michael,Season 2,2x10
5402,I did?,Michael,Season 2,2x10
5404,"What? Oh, shoot. Wow. Okay, well, who cares? It doesn't matter what I spent. What matters is that Christmas is fun, right?",Michael,Season 2,2x10
5405,Michael.,Dwight,Season 2,2x10
5406,"Oh hey, for me. What is in here? [opens a handmade oven mitt] Oh, come on.",Michael,Season 2,2x10
5408,An oven mitt? Okay. [walks out],Michael,Season 2,2x10
5409,"So Phyllis is basically saying, 'Hey Michael, I know you did a lot to help the office this year but I only care about you a homemade oven mitt's worth.' I gave Ryan an iPod.",Michael,Season 2,2x10
5411,We don't do anything until Michael gives us further instructions.,Dwight,Season 2,2x10
5412,I got it! We are going to turn Secret Santa into Yankee Swap.,Michael,Season 2,2x10
5413,What is Yankee Swap?,Jim,Season 2,2x10
5414,"One person chooses a gift. The next person can either choose a gift or steal that person's gift. If your gift gets stolen, then you can steal somebody else's gift or choose a new gift.",Michael,Season 2,2x10
5415,I thought that was called Nasty Christmas.,Jim,Season 2,2x10
5416,"Yeah, we call it White Elephant.",Pam,Season 2,2x10
5417,"Well, I call it fun!",Michael,Season 2,2x10
5419,Because it's better. Because it's more special.,Michael,Season 2,2x10
5421,"Shut it. No, it's not. Okay, just give it a shot.",Michael,Season 2,2x10
5423,"Okay, Meredith is up first. Here's the deal. You can either pick a new gift or you can steal somebody else's gift that they've already gotten, like the oven mitt.",Michael,Season 2,2x10
5425,"Oh, shouldn't we ... I bought that specifically for Pam.",Jim,Season 2,2x10
5426,"Yankee Swap! That's what makes it fun. Pam, you can steal the oven mitt now.",Michael,Season 2,2x10
5427,I'll take the iPod.,Pam,Season 2,2x10
5429,"Yes, now you can steal the oven mitt, the old shirt or the shower radio or pick a new gift.",Dwight,Season 2,2x10
5432,I think this is going great.,Michael,Season 2,2x10
5436,"Angela, you're up.",Dwight,Season 2,2x10
5439,Everyone wants the iPod. It's a huge hit. It is almost a Christmas miracle.,Michael,Season 2,2x10
5440,"Oh, well, Oscar, you little gourmand, you have the next turn.",Michael,Season 2,2x10
5443,"Okay, moving along. Meredith, let's go.",Dwight,Season 2,2x10
5445,It's already been stolen this round. Pick something else.,Dwight,Season 2,2x10
5446,"[holding oven mitt] I hope nobody takes this baby, cause this is great. Wow, look at that fine craftsmanship. Somebody really put a lot of work into that. It's beautiful.",Michael,Season 2,2x10
5448,"Sucker! See, I wanted somebody to take it. Boom! Reverse psychology.",Michael,Season 2,2x10
5449,"Reverse psychology is an awesome tool. I don't know if you guys know about it, but basically you make someone think the opposite of what you believe and that tricks them into doing something stupid. Works like a charm.",Michael,Season 2,2x10
5450,"[opens present] 'In addition to these paintball pellets, your gift includes two paintball lessons with Dwight Schrute.'",Michael,Season 2,2x10
5451,"You and me, Michael. Yes!",Dwight,Season 2,2x10
5452,Who wants to take paintball lessons? How is that better than an iPod?,Michael,Season 2,2x10
5453,I never said it was better than an iPod.,Dwight,Season 2,2x10
5454,"Michael keeps bragging about his iPod, but you know what? Two paintball lessons with someone as experienced as I am is worth easily, like, 2 grand.",Dwight,Season 2,2x10
5455,"[shooting paintball gun at target] Take that, Saddam!",Dwight,Season 2,2x10
5456,Last gift. Kevin.,Michael,Season 2,2x10
5459,"Pam, steal something or pick the final gift.",Dwight,Season 2,2x10
5460,I want the iPod.,Pam,Season 2,2x10
5462,Sure you don't want the teapot?,Jim,Season 2,2x10
5463,"Well, I mean, it's an iPod. But ..",Pam,Season 2,2x10
5464,Right.,Jim,Season 2,2x10
5465,"Sorry, I ..",Pam,Season 2,2x10
5466,No. No. Definitely. It's ..,Jim,Season 2,2x10
5468,Yes! There you go. I want the teapot. Gracias.,Dwight,Season 2,2x10
5469,Got to be kidding me.,Jim,Season 2,2x10
5470,Yankee Swap is like Machiavelli meets ... Christmas.,Dwight,Season 2,2x10
5471,[after Phyllis leaves suddenly] What is she so upset about?,Michael,Season 2,2x10
5472,Maybe because you hated her present so much.,Pam,Season 2,2x10
5473,Come on! I think that Yankee Swap was a big hit! I think it's a success and I'm the one who ended up with Dwight's stupid paintball pellets.,Michael,Season 2,2x10
5474,"Yeah, but, Michael, the point is that we all bought gifts for specific people.",Jim,Season 2,2x10
5476,"Well, I didn't. I got a big bonus because I fired Devon, and I used the money to buy something awesome. Sue me!",Michael,Season 2,2x10
5478,How much?,Pam,Season 2,2x10
5479,"It wasn't. It wasn't that much. It was $3,000.",Michael,Season 2,2x10
5481,"Unbelievable. I do the nicest thing that anyone has ever done for these people and they freak out. Well, happy birthday, Jesus. Sorry your party's so lame.",Michael,Season 2,2x10
5483,"All right, now, you're the expert. Is this enough to get 20 people plastered?",Michael,Season 2,2x10
5485,"Cool, cool. Box it up.",Michael,Season 2,2x10
5486,"I bought this teapot for Pam, and I know she really wants it. So, can I trade you for it?",Jim,Season 2,2x10
5487,No trades.,Dwight,Season 2,2x10
5488,"Come on, it's a shamrock keychain. Good luck.",Jim,Season 2,2x10
5489,A real man makes his own luck.' Billy Zane.,Dwight,Season 2,2x10
5490,"Look, it has sentimental value, Dwight. Can I buy it from you?",Jim,Season 2,2x10
5491,No. I want it. I'm going to use it.,Dwight,Season 2,2x10
5492,You don't even drink tea.,Jim,Season 2,2x10
5493,"True. But I get sinus infections, and sinus infections can be cured by making your tea from green tea leaf stems ..",Dwight,Season 2,2x10
5495,".. and pouring it directly into your nose, like so. [demonstrates]",Dwight,Season 2,2x10
5496,"To think that my gift for Pam will be used for that, it's a little too much to handle.",Jim,Season 2,2x10
5498,I know. It's totally going to change the way I work out.,Pam,Season 2,2x10
5500,So what are you going to get me instead?,Pam,Season 2,2x10
5502,Uh-oh. Looks like Santa was a little naughty.,Michael,Season 2,2x10
5504,"This is Christmas spirit, as in spirits, booze.",Michael,Season 2,2x10
5507,"Zip it, Toby! Just .. I mean, it's a party. Come on. If I can't throw a good party for my employees, then I am a terrible boss. Who wants a drink?",Michael,Season 2,2x10
5509,"Go, here we go!",Michael,Season 2,2x10
5531,"Anybody making out in here? [checks hallway] Not yet, give it time. Oh, hey, Ebenezer, boink. [takes picture of Jim] Okay, how's it going in here? [takes picture of Meredith and Kevin]",Michael,Season 2,2x10

5542,"[laughs] No, I was just checking out my present. [holds up teapot]",Pam,Season 2,2x10
5543,But ..,Jim,Season 2,2x10

5545,"Well, either way. This is an amazing gift because it comes with bonus gifts. Look inside.",Jim,Season 2,2x10

5547,"Yeah, I think I made the right choice.",Pam,Season 2,2x10
5548,"Oh, my God! It's incredible. [Jim reaches and steals his card back before she can notice it] Is this the Boggle timer?",Pam,Season 2,2x10
5549,I didn't think you were going to get that one. I really didn't.,Jim,Season 2,2x10
5550,This is so awesome.,Dwight,Season 2,2x10
5551,"Not bad. And if it couldn't go to Ryan, you are the guy I'd want it to go to.",Michael,Season 2,2x10
5552,Thank you.,Dwight,Season 2,2x10

5574,You shouldn't do things like that. The man is supposed to do that.,Dwight,Season 2,2x10
5579,Yes.,Dwight,Season 2,2x10
5581,"Yeah, that sounds good.",Michael,Season 2,2x10
5582,"Christmas is awesome. First of all, you get to spend time with people you love. Secondly, you can get drunk and no one can say anything. Third, you give presents. What's better than giving presents? And fourth, getting presents. So, four things. Not bad for one day. It's really the greatest day of all time.",Michael,Season 2,2x10
5583,"Hey, Meredith. Heading over to Poor Richard's?",Michael,Season 2,2x10

5587,Okay!,Michael,Season 2,2x10
5593,"Remember on that animated special when they taught the uh, the monster to put the star on top? That's Dwight. Dwight's the monster that we taught to put the star on top of the tree. You take his teeth out, and he could put the star on top of the tree.",Michael,Season 2,2x10
5594,Do you want me to help you with that?,Pam,Season 2,2x10
5596,Phyllis and Angela and Meredith are helpers. I guess Angela's kind of... Angela's little. Phyllis and Meredith are not little. Pam is sort of a medium helper.,Michael,Season 2,2x10
5597,Okay. Christmas lights? Good. Tinsel? Good. Star? Good.,Dwight,Season 2,2x10
5598,"Dwight is... Dwight looks like Spock to me. He always wears the ears, and I always give him grief about looking like Spock, and he hates it because he has a different pair of ears that he wears to be Spock, for some reason.",Michael,Season 2,2x10

5608,"Just let us open up the presents, Dwight.",Pam,Season 2,2x10
5609,Absolutely... not.,Dwight,Season 2,2x10
5610,"What separates humans from jungle beasts? The fact that we have rules. When humans give each other gifts, they do it properly and orderly. When bears give each other gifts they just rip open a fox carcass and present it to their mate. I prefer the human way.",Dwight,Season 2,2x10
5612,"Well, thank God you didn't steal my oven mitt. And Oscar, you little gourmand, your turn.",Michael,Season 2,2x10
5619,"Oscar, paint ball pellets.",Michael,Season 2,2x10

5632,"I do enjoy a drink now and again, but tonight, no. I am also an officer of the law and I'm unofficially on the clock. I need to stay sober and alert. Also, on a personal note, I'm not at my best when I drink.",Dwight,Season 2,2x10
5647,"See, that's what Christmas is all about to me, is when you see someone open a gift and you think, 'Man, I wish I got that.' I mean, that's just such a great feeling, to watch other people envying a gift that you gave to somebody else. I don't know, it's just... I don't know, just makes you kind of feel good.",Michael,Season 2,2x10
5648,Hey.,Jim,Season 2,2x11
5649,Hello. Jim?,Dwight,Season 2,2x11
5650,"What's up, buddy?",Jim,Season 2,2x11
5651,This is not funny. Why is my stuff in here?,Dwight,Season 2,2x11

5704,"Well, just keep the tags on and you can return it.",Michael,Season 2,2x11
5706,"Well, that's not my fault, okay? Just.. we're not going to pay for a bathing suit. Okay, I know what you're all thinking, 'Who is this smart little cookie?' Her name is Brenda... something, and she is from corporate. And she is here, like you, to learn from what I have to say.",Michael,Season 2,2x11
5707,"I am a great motivational speaker. I attended a Tony Robbins event by the airport last year, and... it wasn't the actual course. You have to pay for the actual course. But it talked about the actual course. And I've incorporated a lot of his ideas into my own course.",Michael,Season 2,2x11
5708,"Leader... ship. The word 'ship' is hidden inside the word 'leadership,' as its derivation. So if this office is, in fact, a ship, as its leader, I am the captain. But we're all in the same boat. Teamwork!",Michael,Season 2,2x11
5710,"Now, on this ship that is the office, what is a sales department? Anyone?",Michael,Season 2,2x11
5712,"Yes, Darryl, the sales department makes sales. Good. Let me just explain. I see the sales department as the furnace.",Michael,Season 2,2x11
5714,"Yeesh, how old is this ship?",Jim,Season 2,2x11
5715,How about the anchor?,Pam,Season 2,2x11
5717,"All right, let's not get hung up on the furnace. This just... it's the sales... I see the sales department down there.

Show of hands!",Michael,Season 2,2x11

5722,"Michael stands in the front of the boat and says that he's king of the world within the first hour, or I give you my next paycheck.",Jim,Season 2,2x11
5724,"No! Thank you, spoiler alert. You saw the movie, those of you who did. They're happy down there in the furnace room. And they're dirty and grimy and sweaty, and they're singing their ethnic songs, and... actually, that might be warehouse.",Michael,Season 2,2x11

6261,You don't think you should sit in the back with Dwight?,Jim,Season 2,2x12
6262,The rules of shotgun are very simple and very clear.  The first person to shout 'shotgun' when you're within the sight of the car gets the front seat.  That's how  the game's played.  There are no exceptions for someone with a concussion.,Michael,Season 2,2x12
6263,"Oh, God, a mini-van.  What is Meredith's problem?",Michael,Season 2,2x12
6264,"Well, I think she has a kid.",Jim,Season 2,2x12

6305,Nothing.  I wrote 'bringing someone to the hospital'.,Michael,Season 2,2x12
6306,So you thought they meant your reason for coming to the hospital.,Jim,Season 2,2x12
6307,"No... you know what Jim, this isn't about me anymore.  I made a miraculous recovery, which is more than I can say for him. [Dwight falls towards Jim]",Michael,Season 2,2x12

6312,"Doctor, what is more serious, a head injury or a foot injury?",Michael,Season 2,2x12

6316,What is that?,Dwight,Season 2,2x12
6317,"Look since you have the machine up and running, can I just stick my foot, we take a look?",Michael,Season 2,2x12

6460,Question? May I investigate?,Dwight,Season 2,2x13
6461,Yeah. Drop what you're doing. Make this a priority. Because an office can't function efficiently unless people are at their desks doing their jobs.,Michael,Season 2,2x13
6462,I bought my veil.,Pam,Season 2,2x13
6464,Ummm...,Pam,Season 2,2x13

6470,Hey Michael.,Jim,Season 2,2x13
6471,Hey Jim-bag.,Michael,Season 2,2x13

6477,Wow!,Michael,Season 2,2x13
6478,"Jim and I are great friends. We hang out a ton, mostly at work. But, the fact that he told me his secret and no one else knows says everything about our friendship.  And it is why, I intend on keeping that secret for as long as I possibly can.",Michael,Season 2,2x13
6479,My lips are sealed. [singing] My lips are sealed... Bangles.,Michael,Season 2,2x13

Sounds like you're too sick to come into work but your well enough to go to the pharmacy.",Dwight,Season 2,2x13
6503,"There are several different ways to tell if a perp is lying. The liar will avoid direct eye contact. The liar will cover part of his or her face with his hands, especially the mouth.

6508,Nothing.,Michael,Season 2,2x13
6509,"Oh, really nothing? Fact: You are drinking grape soda. You never drink grape soda.  Fact: You are talking to Jim. You never talk to Jim.",Dwight,Season 2,2x13
6510,Fact: I love grape soda. I always have. Fact: Jim and I talk all the time. We tell each other secrets.,Michael,Season 2,2x13
6511,Ok. So what is the secret Michael?,Dwight,Season 2,2x13
6512,"Um, I had asked Michael if I could head up the Oscar investigation and he said that only Dwight was capable of handling such sensitive material.",Jim,Season 2,2x13

7092,We could do it in the warehouse.,Dwight,Season 2,2x15
7094,"OK, OK, Fine. Yeah, actually, perfect. Perfect. You know what? There's another side to this place, gentleman. And I know we all love our cushy jobs and our fun, exciting office. But do you realize that underneath us, there's another world. The warehouse world. A world that is teeming with sweat and dirt and life. Life. The bowels of the office. These guys are down there, they are real men doing real man's work. We are going to learn how a warehouse works.",Michael,Season 2,2x15

Big day. Now you may look around and see two groups here. White collar. Blue collar. But I don't see it that way. And you know why not? Because I am collar-blind.,Michael,Season 2,2x15
7120,I don't know how I fit in with these women. Here. Or with Jan. Um... I mean we get along great. Fine. Um... I guess the person I have the most in common with is...,Pam,Season 2,2x15

7305,I have essentially. Yes. I've taken some...,Michael,Season 2,2x15
7307,Dreams are just that. They're dreams. They help get you through the day. Like the thing about the terrace. It's nice but... um... I don't know. It was just something I read in this book when I was twelve. The girl in the book has a terrace outside of her bedroom and she planted flowers on it and I just loved that. Just always kind of stuck with me.,Pam,Season 2,2x15
7308,So you're not doing it.,Jim,Season 2,2x15
7309,How did you know?,Pam,Season 2,2x15

7316,"You got to take a chance on something sometime, Pam. I mean, do you want to be a receptionist here, always?",Jim,Season 2,2x15
7317,"Oh, excuse me! I'm fine with my choices!",Pam,Season 2,2x15
7318,You are?,Jim,Season 2,2x15
7319,Yeah.,Pam,Season 2,2x15

7321,I'm just going to put this over there.,Michael,Season 2,2x15

7330,Ahhh! Excellent.,Michael,Season 2,2x15
7331,Is it good to be back. Yeah. I mean I love the guy stuff but to run an office you need men and women. You know why? Because you need to have that crazy sexual tension to keep things interesting.,Michael,Season 2,2x15

And even though it was really great, and she had a great time, she ends up back home in Kansas and says, 'There's no place like home.' And that's how I feel right now. There is no place like home.

7542,"No no no no no, yes I, OK, well, alright, here's the deal. It's my fault. This is, this is totally on me. Before you guys came in, I was talking to the guys.

7576,"This is where it's all happening. We got TGI Fridays. I'm in the picture! Sometimes I just jump into people's pictures. Lot of people have their picture taken. It's kind of a New Yorker thing. You jump in on a tourist's picture and kind of ruin it. There's an energy to New York that you just feel. Um, everybody... Don't get hit. Everybody is kind of together and everybody hates each other, but loves each other at the same time. Screw off! People just yell at each other in New York, and it's great.",Michael,Season 2,2x16
7579,I'm gonna spend it with my fiance.,Pam,Season 2,2x16

7615,Think it through.,Dwight,Season 2,2x17

7649,"What if I give a really long, extended Thank You. For instance, 'Thank you, Mr. Blank. Thank you very, very, very...'",Dwight,Season 2,2x17

7652,I can't do this.,Dwight,Season 2,2x17

8503,[fake coughing] Narc!,Michael,Season 2,2x20
8505,If you are attempting to compliment me then you have done a very good job.,Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8506,I wasn't attempting to compliment you.,Michael,Season 2,2x20
8507,"Well, you have...",Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8508,"Uuf, well...",Michael,Season 2,2x20
8509,...because being a narc is one of the hardest jobs that you can have...,Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8510,[shakes head] Okay...,Michael,Season 2,2x20
8511,...and I am very proud of being a narc.,Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8512,"Why don't you just cool it, cool it Dwight, please, God! [to Jim] Dude, where's my office? [Jim quietly laughs] I totally lost it, 'cause I was half-baked. Smokin' doobies. Doobie brothers, I was smokin' doobies with my brothers. Peace out, Seacrest!",Michael,Season 2,2x20
8513,"Well, your office is behind you.",Jim,Season 2,2x20
8514,Thanks. M-m-munchies. Who wants some munchies?,Michael,Season 2,2x20
8516,Oscar visited Mexico when he was five to attend his great-grandmother's funeral. What does that mean to a United States law enforcement officer? He's a potential drug mule.,Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8517,Have you ever taken any illegal drugs?,Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8519,Do you think it's possible that maybe you could have had some drugs in your system without you knowing about it?,Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8521,Have you ever... pooped... a balloon?,Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8523,He sure left in a hurry.,Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8524,I don't want to blow this. This is what all good law enforcement officers dream of. The chance to solve an actual crime.,Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8525,Do you know what this is? [pushing a photo toward her],Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8527,How do you know that?,Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8529,[grabs pictures back and looks at it] Dammit.,Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8531,"No, it's marijuana.",Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8532,I'm just saying that you can't be sure that is wasn't you.,Jim,Season 2,2x20
8533,"That's ridiculous, of course it wasn't me.",Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8534,"Marijuana is a memory loss drug, so maybe you just don't remember.",Jim,Season 2,2x20
8535,I would remember.,Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8536,"Well, how could you, if it just erased your memory?",Jim,Season 2,2x20
8537,That's not how it works.,Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8538,Now how do you know how it works?,Jim,Season 2,2x20
8539,"Knock it off, okay, I'm interviewing you.",Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8540,No! You said that I'd be conducting the interview when I walked in here. Now exactly how much pot did you smoke?,Jim,Season 2,2x20
8541,[opens eyes wide in total surprise],Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8543,"Oh, um...[mimicking Stanley] Why do you keep CC'ing me on things that have nothing to do with me?  [Pam and Oscar laugh, Stanley walks in, and Oscar leaves quickly]",Jim,Season 2,2x20
8545,"Oh, hey Stanley. Uh, I was just doing an impression.",Jim,Season 2,2x20
8547,He does everyone in the office.,Pam,Season 2,2x20
8550,Jinx! Buy me a coke.,Pam,Season 2,2x20
8551,Oh...,Jim,Season 2,2x20
8552,"No, no, no, no talking. Jim is not allowed to talk until after he buys me a coke.  Those are the rules of jinx, and they are unflinchingly rigid.  [Jim puts money in drink machine, selection is sold out]",Pam,Season 2,2x20
8553,Sold out? That has never happened in the history of jinx.,Pam,Season 2,2x20
8554,[mouths] C'mon!,Jim,Season 2,2x20
8555,"Sorry, that's not my problem.",Pam,Season 2,2x20
8556,"[presses drink button, looks at camera, makes Jim-face]",Jim,Season 2,2x20
8557,"I know you're innocent, but I can't look like I'm treating you any differently.",Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8559,Where were you yesterday after work?,Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8561,Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Who's he calling?  Ratting somebody out.  Narc!  Narc!  Kevin?,Michael,Season 2,2x20
8563,"Remember the narc bit? [laughs] Uh-oh, who's in trouble?",Michael,Season 2,2x20
8564,Attention everyone.  Drug testers are coming in a couple of hours to test everyone's urine.,Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8565,Waa... what? What are you talking about?,Michael,Season 2,2x20
8566,Company policy. If drugs are found on the premises there is automatic drug testing conducted within twenty-four hours.,Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8569,"Two nights ago, I went to an Alicia Keys concert at the Montage Mountain Performing Arts Center. I scored these great aisle seats. Anyway, after the opening act this beautiful girl sits down next to me and I never get to meet girls with lip rings and she had one. I don't know exactly how this happened but one of her friends started passing around some stuff and they said it was clove cigarettes, and I'm sure that it was clove cigarettes. Everybody in the aisle was doing it.",Michael,Season 2,2x20
8570,"Okay, attention everyone the drug testing has been cancelled.  Instead, I will be going around to each of you and doing a visual inspection.",Michael,Season 2,2x20
8571,No you can't do that.,Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8572,"I can do that, it is my office.",Michael,Season 2,2x20
8573,"No you cannot. It has to be official, and it",Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8574,Hmmm. Ha. [under his breath] Alright. Great.,Michael,Season 2,2x20
8575,"Kevin, what prescription drugs are you taking, besides Rogaine?",Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8577,"Angela, what about you?",Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8579,You're not on,Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8581,Good.,Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8583,"Hey guys, what's going on?",Pam,Season 2,2x20
8585,"Oh, okay.  Well, Michael wants to see everyone in the conference room. [Jim shakes his head. Seems relieved to be getting away from Kelly] But you know what? We have a few minutes so you guys should definitely finish up your conversation. [Jim nods his head as if to say, 'Gee, thanks, Pam.']",Pam,Season 2,2x20
8587,It has come to my attention that some people here think that the use of drugs is something to laugh about.,Michael,Season 2,2x20
8591,"No, uh, no. That was a test.  I was testing you, and you all failed. Miserably. When I said that Dwight was a narc, how many of you defended him?  How many of you said, 'Hey, you know what, he's right? What he's doing is protecting this office from the evils of drugs.'",Michael,Season 2,2x20
8592,"Thank you, Michael.",Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8593,"I am ridiculously anti-drug. So anti-drug that I am above suspicion in any way that involves suspicion, or testing of any kind.",Michael,Season 2,2x20
8594,"Drugs ruin lives people. Drugs destroy careers. Take Cheech and Chong everybody knows that Cheech and Chong are funny, but just imagine how funny they would be if they didn't smoke pot.  I want everybody to take a look to their left. Now I want everybody to take a look to their right. One of those people will be dead from drug use at some point in their lives. This year more people will use cocaine than will read a book to their children.",Michael,Season 2,2x20
8596,"Are these facts scaring you, or are they not?",Michael,Season 2,2x20
8598,Do you think that smoking drugs is cool? Do you think that doing alcohol is cool?,Michael,Season 2,2x20
8600,"Okay, enough, enough, enough! I have written down a list of illegal drugs. Take a gander. How many of these are you familiar with?",Michael,Season 2,2x20
8602,Yes it is.,Michael,Season 2,2x20
8604,"Okay, you know what, Toby? Pam, can you take this down? [Pam throws her hands up to indicate she has no notepad] In addition to Toby's urine being tested, I would like to test his blood and his hair.",Michael,Season 2,2x20
8606,"I can test anyone randomly, and I have chosen you randomly.",Michael,Season 2,2x20
8608,"Okay, eeny, meenie, miney, moe, is random.  Okay, you know what? I'm going to need a volunteer to select one of these words and tell us of something tragic that happened in either their lives, or the lives of a loved one.  Yeah, Pam.",Michael,Season 2,2x20
8609,I know that Jim has an amazing story about a relative of his who got caught up in the world of drugs.,Pam,Season 2,2x20
8610,Really? [Jim shakes his head no],Michael,Season 2,2x20
8611,"Uh, hmmm.",Pam,Season 2,2x20
8612,"Jim it's okay. You can t... [Jim looks at Pam and shakes his head, Pam looks at him and gestures for Jim to go up and tell his story] This would be a good place to let it out, Jim. These are people you can trust. These are people who care about you. [Jim shakes his head no] It's okay, just we will not judge you. We are here to not judge you. [Jim stands up] Oh, he's doing it, okay. [Jim looks at Pam] It's okay. [Jim pretends to try, looking teary eyed, shakes his head no, mouths 'I can't' and sits back down. Pam is amazed.] Oh. Okay, are you sure? [Jim shakes his head. Kevin pats his shoulder] That looked like it was going to be good. Alright. [Pam nods in admiration at Jim] Okay, well.",Michael,Season 2,2x20
8613,Wow! He really pulled out the big guns. Fake crying. Did not expect that.,Pam,Season 2,2x20
8614,"The point I'm trying to make with all of this people is that I hate drugs. I hate them, and based upon what I have seen you all don't quite hate 'em as much as I do so you are going to have a drug test, and I am not.",Michael,Season 2,2x20
8615,"No, you will be tested.",Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8616,"Yes, I will not be.",Michael,Season 2,2x20
8617,You will be. That is the law according to the rules.,Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8618,"Okay, well Dwight just know that I've been very busy today and I got a lot of work to do and I wasn't planning on going to the bathroom and I don't even know if anything is going to come out, okay? So good. Thank you.",Michael,Season 2,2x20
8619,"Hi, Linda. Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager. You might remember testing my urine a few years back when I was applying to be a volunteer sheriff's deputy.",Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8621,Mine was green.,Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8623,I'm all better.,Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8624,So I need you to do some work on the St. Andrews account. I need your urine. I need some filing done.,Michael,Season 2,2x20
8625,What kind of filing?,Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8626,Just forget it.  Just the urine.,Michael,Season 2,2x20
8627,That goes directly to the tester.,Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8628,Just. I need your urine.,Michael,Season 2,2x20
8629,Like in a cup?,Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8630,"Yes in a cup, we're not animals, Dwight.",Michael,Season 2,2x20
8631,For what purpose?,Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8632,It's none of your business.,Michael,Season 2,2x20
8633,Then I refuse.,Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8634,"Okay. Alright. Just, I went to an Alicia Keys concert, over the weekend, and I think I may have gotten high accidentally by a girl with a lip ring.",Michael,Season 2,2x20
8635,Are you serious?,Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8636,I need clean urine for the lady.,Michael,Season 2,2x20
8637,But that's illegal.,Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8638,"Don't think of it that way. It's like, urine goes all over the place. You know, there's no controlling it. It just... goes",Michael,Season 2,2x20
8639,Not my urine.,Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8640,A cup could find its way under the urine. It might be an accident. It happens.,Michael,Season 2,2x20
8641,Were you forced to do drugs at this concert?,Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8642,"No, just look. Look. Just... just fill up the cup.",Michael,Season 2,2x20
8644,I want him to have all the urine he needs.,Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8646,I know that. Don't you think I know that?,Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8651,"My father's name was Dwight Schrute. My grandfather's name was Dwight Schrute. His father's name Dwide Schrude. Amish. I loved my father very much. Every morning he'd wake up at dawn and make us biscuits with gravy. When I was little my dad and I played a lot of games together. My dad cheated a lot but I never busted him on it. I would have, except I didn't know about it. He didn't tell me till years later. I was shocked when I found out.",Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8652,"What? [Jim shakes his head] Did you want to tell me something? You look like you want to tell me something. [Jim shakes his head no] You look like you have something really important to say and you just can't for some reason. [Jim smiles] Come on, you can tell me. Jim, you can tell me anything. [Jim stops smiling and looks down. Pam wonders what that means]",Pam,Season 2,2x20
8656,"Dwight. Well, I passed the test thanks to you and your untainted pee. Thank you very much.",Michael,Season 2,2x20
8657,That's great.,Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8658,What's wrong? Where's your costume?,Michael,Season 2,2x20
8659,It's a uniform and I turned it in today when I tendered my resignation.,Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8660,Why?  Wha...,Michael,Season 2,2x20
8661,I took an oath when I was sworn in and I broke that oath today.,Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8662,[placing a coke can in front of Jim] Here. [Jim looks confused] Just buy it from me. I haven't talked to you in hours and it's been weird and I really want to know what the hell's going on with Dwight. [Pam scoots the coke can towards Jim.  Jim pulls out his wallet and hands Pam a dollar.  He gives the coke back to Pam],Pam,Season 2,2x20
8663,Hi.,Jim,Season 2,2x20
8664,Hey.,Pam,Season 2,2x20
8665,How much time do you have left on your break?,Jim,Season 2,2x20
8666,Ten minutes.,Pam,Season 2,2x20

8668,Really?,Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8669,"Yes, sir.",Michael,Season 2,2x20
8670,That's fantastic because I've always felt that the security here sucked .,Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8671,So you wanna? Thanks.,Michael,Season 2,2x20
8673,Okay.,Michael,Season 2,2x20
8675,"Thank you, Michael. Very nice. Great. [To Hank]  Can I have a gun?",Dwight,Season 2,2x20

8680,"[salutes] Thank you, Michael.",Dwight,Season 2,2x20

8683,"Alright. [to Hank] Well, Thank you.",Michael,Season 2,2x20
8684,"First of all, Hank, how many orange traffic cones do you have?",Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8686,"Oh, God.",Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8687,Wow. What a terrible day to not be able to talk.  Dwight was literally carrying around his own urine and dressed like one of the Village People. Why does he do the things that he does for Michael?  I just don't get it. What is he getting out of that relationship?,Jim,Season 2,2x20
8688,[growling] Nice.,Jim,Season 2,2x20
8689,Kevin.,Pam,Season 2,2x20
8690,Yeah.,Jim,Season 2,2x20

8699,"People use marijuana to escape. Jim does not have a girlfriend. His sales are nothing to brag about. And he does not belong to any organized clubs. If that were my life, I'd do drugs.",Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8705,"Your turn, Stanley. [Stanley just takes a drink from his mug] Angela, you're up.",Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8706,Last night? Let's see.,Pam,Season 2,2x20
8707,Go ahead. Don't lie.,Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8708,I won't. It's just that last night is really hard for me to remember because I was just a teensy bit high. Should I have not said that?,Pam,Season 2,2x20
8709,"No, no, no. It's okay. Go ahead.",Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8710,I know that I shouldn't have done it. But I was in the parking lot at the Quick and Easy.,Pam,Season 2,2x20
8711,Oh.,Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8712,And I took a bong hit from my Bong Water with my pimp.,Pam,Season 2,2x20

8719,Exactly. I know. It's amazing.,Michael,Season 2,2x20
8722,Shut... Shut it. No. Just... Just focus on the facts. Cocaine. They use cocaine.,Michael,Season 2,2x20
8723,"Oh, me? Just one of the gang. Sitting in the back, doodling, not playing attention. Bam! Pow! Surprise! Got you!

8724,"One thing that you need to remember is that there's no way of knowing who's a user, who's an abuser, because we don't know. It could be anybody. Your instinct is to say it's somebody-like Stanley or Oscar...",Michael,Season 2,2x20
8726,"No, no! Your instinct. That... Your gut reaction is to say that, but I don't! That's, that's... Those are instincts that have been created by media and hype. And they are wrong. What I am saying is that you just do not know who drug users are. It may be the person you least suspect. It may be somebody hot, like Pam, or it could be somebody matronly, like Phyllis, but just not me.",Michael,Season 2,2x20
8728,"No? okay, fine.",Michael,Season 2,2x20
8730,"Okay, well, I really think that... [dial tone beeping]",Michael,Season 2,2x20

8735,"Okay, let's get personal for a second, shall we?",Michael,Season 2,2x20
8736,"The scary thing is, it could have been any one of these people. They all had a motive. To get high.",Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8737,"Okay, well, I made up some fliers for everybody to take on your way out, in case you're ever tempted. So there you go. And, Dwight, you know, I'm very busy today. It wasn't even planning on going to the bathroom, so I don't even know if anything will come out.",Michael,Season 2,2x20
8738,just drink a lot of water.,Dwight,Season 2,2x20
8739,Well...,Michael,Season 2,2x20

8741,"I don't... Let's just not talk about it, okay?",Michael,Season 2,2x20
8742,[reading from Michael's flier] 'Drugs: Let's not and say we did.' I think Michael was high when he wrote this.,Pam,Season 2,2x20

8822,"Just hold on, please! Okay, if we do lose/lose, neither of you gets what you want. Do you understand? You... you would both lose. Now I need to ask you, do you want to pursue a lose/lose negotiation?",Michael,Season 2,2x21

8825,"[in front of poster] Okay, since this is the disputed poster. Now, one at a time, I want you to express your feelings using 'I' emotion language and no judging or 'you' statements.",Michael,Season 2,2x21
8827,"Come on, seriously, that?",Michael,Season 2,2x21
8829,"Okay, okay. Stop, stop, stop! Let's see if we can just brainstorm and find some creative alternatives that are win/win.",Michael,Season 2,2x21
8830,Win!,Pam,Season 2,2x21
8831,"Yes. Thank you, Pam. How about Angela makes the poster into a t-shirt, which Oscar wears. That way, he can never see it and whenever she looks at Oscar, she can see it. Win/win/win.",Michael,Season 2,2x21
8834,"Okay... well, brainstorm. Own the solution.",Michael,Season 2,2x21
8837,"How about, Angela can keep it up on Tuesdays and Thursdays?",Pam,Season 2,2x21
8838,"Okay, that is called a compromise. And it is style 3. And it is not ideal. To sum up, win/win - make the poster into a t-shirt, win/lose - take the poster down, compromise - Tuesdays and Thursdays. And the answer is... make the poster into a t-shirt! Win/win.",Michael,Season 2,2x21
8839,Win.,Pam,Season 2,2x21
8842,[claps his hands twice] It is done!,Michael,Season 2,2x21
8843,Win,Pam,Season 2,2x21
8846,"Hey, Angela.[hands her a Save The Date card] I didn't have your zip code.",Pam,Season 2,2x21
8850,Yes.,Michael,Season 2,2x21
8852,Are those all the other complains?,Michael,Season 2,2x21
8854,I would like to see those please.,Michael,Season 2,2x21
8856,"You can't do that, huh? Huh, ok. Now you and I have a conflict. I order you to give me that file.",Michael,Season 2,2x21
8858,"Okay. [yanks the file away, despite Toby's resistance] There! No more conflict. [looks at the camera] I had to use win/lose on that. It was not pretty. [looks back at Toby] All right... is that it?",Michael,Season 2,2x21
8861,Ohh... God. Alright. Why do I have to do everything?,Michael,Season 2,2x21
8863,"Oh, he's sure. Just shoot.",Dwight,Season 2,2x21
8865,"[looking through papers in the complaint box] This is from Kevin. He says Stanley uses his Miracle Whip without asking. Meredith complains that everyone talks too loud in the morning and the lights are too bright. Creed... huh. Duh, duh. Creed is sick of looking at the redhead all day and wants a seat facing the receptionist.",Michael,Season 2,2x21
8866,Nice.,Pam,Season 2,2x21
8867,You will notice that not one of these complaints is against me.,Michael,Season 2,2x21
8869,"How many of you have at one time gone to Toby to complain about another employee? [looks at all the employees, most of whom raise their hands] And... did you get what you wanted, or were you merely listened to, you forget about your problem, and you move on? [employees mumble 'merely listen to and forgotten...' ] That is outrageous! I love this place... and it pains me to see all of the negativity festering... [sighs] Okay, today we are going to get everything out of these files and into the open, where it can be resolved. Alright, how about the Phyllis/Angela dispute?",Michael,Season 2,2x21
8871,"That's what she said. [Jim mouths these words along with Michael] The thing is, Angela... you are in here an awful lot. You have complained about everybody in the office, except Dwight, which is odd because everyone else has had run ins with Dwight. Toby, by the way, what does 'redacted' mean? There is a file full of complaints in here marked 'redacted'... ?",Michael,Season 2,2x21
8873,"Oh, ok. There were a bunch of complaints about Dwight that were put in the redacted file about six months ago.",Michael,Season 2,2x21
8874,"Whoa.. wha... wait. If someone has a problem with me, why would they withdraw it six months ago?",Dwight,Season 2,2x21
8875,[notices Angela's intense concern] Um... let's move on. I volunteer. Did anyone have a problem with me?,Pam,Season 2,2x21
8876,"All right, Pamela. Come on down! Let's do it! And [looks through the file]... okay. Just one complaint. Actually, it has been withdrawn. So that is no help to us. Next.",Michael,Season 2,2x21
8877,"Wait, what did it say?",Pam,Season 2,2x21
8878,"Uh... [reading]'Does she have to plan her wedding on office time? Couldn't she do that at home?' [Pam looks Angela an angry look] Who else? Why don't we just warm up first? Warm up emotionally, all right?",Michael,Season 2,2x21
8879,I have this kind of big secret about Angela. And I've been really nice to her... and I haven't told anyone. And what the hell?!,Pam,Season 2,2x21
8880,"Here is a Kelly complaint: 'Ryan never returns my calls.' Ugh, join the club.",Michael,Season 2,2x21
8886,[crumbles up the complaint paper] Makin' progress. [Jim raises his hand] Yes?,Michael,Season 2,2x21
8887,Dwight tried to kiss me.,Jim,Season 2,2x21
8888,What?!,Michael,Season 2,2x21
8889,And I didn't tell anyone because I'm not really sure how I feel about it.,Jim,Season 2,2x21
8890,That is not true. Redact it. Redact it!,Dwight,Season 2,2x21
8891,"Well, I'm not actually making a formal complaint. I just really think we should talk about it.",Jim,Season 2,2x21
8892,"Okay, question. [looks at Toby] When a name is withdrawn, does that also apply to the permanent misbehavior file in New York?",Dwight,Season 2,2x21
8894,Stanley. [off camera],Michael,Season 2,2x21
8895,"[gets up and walks over to Angela, whispering to her] Hey. Thanks for ratting me out!",Pam,Season 2,2x21
8896,[still of camera] You got a lot of anger under there buddy. Come on start us out. Unleash it.,Michael,Season 2,2x21
8898,I find that hard to believe... considering you have problems with every single person in this entire office except Bobblehead Joe.,Pam,Season 2,2x21
8899,"Someone complained that the men's room is 'whites only'. Stanley, you know that's not true.",Michael,Season 2,2x21
8902,"Okay, Phyllis. You complained that Angela's giving you dirty looks. And you tried to get off the party planning committee.",Michael,Season 2,2x21
8904,"And... also, Phyllis, Stanley says that you cry too much, and that bugs him.",Michael,Season 2,2x21
8907,Oh... ok.,Michael,Season 2,2x21
8909,"I can't believe Angela. I went against my better judgment, and I gave her a Save The Date. And now it turns out she complained about me to Toby.",Pam,Season 2,2x21
8910,"Well, it was redacted. Look, if she wants an invite, maybe she's just trying to be friends.",Jim,Season 2,2x21
8911,Don't take her side.,Pam,Season 2,2x21
8912,"[sighs] Well, what does Roy think about everything?",Jim,Season 2,2x21
8913,I don't know. I try not to bother him about this kind of stuff.,Pam,Season 2,2x21
8914,You mean your thoughts and feelings?,Jim,Season 2,2x21
8915,Yeah.,Pam,Season 2,2x21
8916,Yeah...,Jim,Season 2,2x21
8920,"Okay, well... all settled, then.",Michael,Season 2,2x21
8922,"OK, Ryan.  You told Toby that Creed has a distinct old man smell?",Michael,Season 2,2x21
8924,"All right, Kevin. You are accused of making sexually suggestive remarks to Angela that made her feel uncomfortable. Solution:  Angela, you are to make sexually suggestive remarks to Kevin that will make him uncomfortable.",Michael,Season 2,2x21
8926,"Hey... you know what, Dwight? Maybe we should get our photo I.D. taken together.",Jim,Season 2,2x21
8927,That doesn't make any sense.,Dwight,Season 2,2x21
8928,"Well, it saves time, you know. 'Cause we could just meet in the parking lot every morning. Walk in together. Perfect.",Jim,Season 2,2x21
8930,No.,Dwight,Season 2,2x21
8931,"I never smile if I can help it. Showing one's teeth is a submission signal in primates. When someone smiles at me, all I see is a chimpanzee begging for its life.",Dwight,Season 2,2x21
8932,This came out really well. [picks up Dwight's I.D. from the laminating machine and hands it to Dwight] There you go.,Jim,Season 2,2x21
8933,This is humongous. I am not a security threat...,Dwight,Season 2,2x21
8934,Oh.,Jim,Season 2,2x21
8935,"And my middle name is 'Kurt', not 'Fart'.",Dwight,Season 2,2x21
8936,What did I write?,Jim,Season 2,2x21
8937,I have another complaint for Jim's permanent file.,Dwight,Season 2,2x21
8939,What box?!,Dwight,Season 2,2x21
8942,Uh. Dwight.,Michael,Season 2,2x21
8943,"Ah... agh... dgh... Ahh! No, no! Four years of malfeasance unreported. This cannot stand.",Dwight,Season 2,2x21
8944,Okay! Calm down.,Michael,Season 2,2x21
8945,No! You calm down! Who's side is Toby on? Who's side are you on?,Dwight,Season 2,2x21
8946,"Hey, hey!",Michael,Season 2,2x21
8947,Him or me?,Dwight,Season 2,2x21
8948,Stop.,Michael,Season 2,2x21
8949,Him or me? I cannot work with Jim anymore.,Dwight,Season 2,2x21
8950,Okay...,Michael,Season 2,2x21
8951,"Either he goes, or I go.",Dwight,Season 2,2x21
8952,Dwight...,Michael,Season 2,2x21
8953,You choose!,Dwight,Season 2,2x21
8954,Stop...,Michael,Season 2,2x21
8955,One of us is out of here by the end of today! [runs out],Dwight,Season 2,2x21
8956,Oh... kay...,Michael,Season 2,2x21
8957,I am not bluffing!,Dwight,Season 2,2x21
8958,Okay.,Michael,Season 2,2x21
8959,Okay?,Dwight,Season 2,2x21
8960,Yes.,Michael,Season 2,2x21
8961,"Do the right thing here, Michael. Okay, I have served you loyally for years.",Dwight,Season 2,2x21
8962,Mm-hmm.,Michael,Season 2,2x21
8963,I deserve this. You know I do!,Dwight,Season 2,2x21
8964,[picks up Dwight's I.D. and snickers] You know your I.D. says you're a security threat?,Michael,Season 2,2x21
8965,You have till five.,Dwight,Season 2,2x21
8966,"Oh, look, Jim. There's a sales manager position open in Stamford. Want me to call Jan and tell her you're interested? I could put in a good word for you, 'cause I'll still be working here. Transfer! Transfer! Everybody! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer!",Dwight,Season 2,2x21
8967,"Okay... you two, in the conference room with me. Nobody leaves until we work this out. Cage match!",Michael,Season 2,2x21
8968,"Cage matches? Yeah, they work. How could they not work? If they didn't work, everybody would still be in the cage.",Michael,Season 2,2x21
8969,"Okay, so Dwight, in your own words - [reads from complaint paper] 'Someone replaced all my pens and pencils with crayons. I suspect Jim Halpert.' [flips to another paper] 'Everyone has called me 'Dwayne' all day. I think Jim Halpert paid them to.'",Michael,Season 2,2x21
8970,[laughs] Yes! Five bucks each. And it was totally worth it.,Jim,Season 2,2x21
8971,"[reading] 'This morning, I found a bloody glove in my desk drawer and Jim Halpert tried to convince me I committed murder. I think he may be the real murderer.' [flips to another paper] 'Jim Halpert said there was an abandoned infant in the woman's room. When I went to save the child, I saw Meredith on the can.'  Gah. 'This morning, I knocked myself in the head with the phone.'",Michael,Season 2,2x21
8972,"That actually took a while. I had to put, uh, more and more nickels into his handset, till he got used to the weight, and then I just... took 'em all out.",Jim,Season 2,2x21
8973,"[reading] 'Every time I typed my name, it said 'Diapers'.'",Michael,Season 2,2x21
8974,"Just a simple macro. You know, these actually don't sound that funny one after another. But he does deserve it, though.",Jim,Season 2,2x21
8975,"By the end of the day, my desk was about two feet closer to the copier.'",Michael,Season 2,2x21
8976,"Yeah, I just moved it an inch every time he went to the bathroom. And that's how I spent my entire day that day.",Jim,Season 2,2x21
8977,"The Japanese have this thing called shiatsu massage, where they dig into your body, very hard. And it is very painful. And apparently, some people throw up. But the next day they feel great. I've never had one. They sound awful.",Michael,Season 2,2x21
8978,Maybe Stanford would be cool.,Jim,Season 2,2x21
8979,It's a good market. Higher volume.,Dwight,Season 2,2x21
8980,Yeah. Maybe we should both go.,Jim,Season 2,2x21
8981,I have a girlfriend...,Dwight,Season 2,2x21
8982,"Sure you do, Dwight. Sure.",Jim,Season 2,2x21
8983,"Hey, there's like, 300 more of these. Let's get to them later.",Michael,Season 2,2x21
8984,"So, you going to transfer Jim or not?",Dwight,Season 2,2x21
8985,"Maybe, I haven't decided yet. Let's get to work.",Michael,Season 2,2x21
8986,I want an answer by tomorrow.,Dwight,Season 2,2x21
8987,"Okay. Oh... actually, tomorrow's not good. How about later in the week?",Michael,Season 2,2x21
8988,Fine.,Dwight,Season 2,2x21
8989,Good. Okay.,Michael,Season 2,2x21
8990,Hey! Wait. How about a group picture while you're here?,Michael,Season 2,2x21
8992,"Well... that's... what, a computer camera, right?",Michael,Season 2,2x21
8994,It'll take like two seconds.,Michael,Season 2,2x21
8996,"Ugh... All right. Everybody, [looks around at the employees] come on. Group photo for the newsletter.",Michael,Season 2,2x21
8998,"Come on, everybody.",Michael,Season 2,2x21
8999,"Come on, let's go. Creed, Kevin, Oscar... andale! Let's go.",Dwight,Season 2,2x21
9001,"We resolved a lot today, everybody. Think happy thoughts.",Michael,Season 2,2x21
9003,"Good, let's check that out. [looks at preview screen] Ew, okay, all right. One more. We'll take one more.",Michael,Season 2,2x21
9005,What?,Michael,Season 2,2x21
9006,"Angela, I want to talk to you about something.",Pam,Season 2,2x21
9007,[off camera] You just press the button.,Michael,Season 2,2x21
9009,"No, Pam.",Jim,Season 2,2x21
9010,[looks at to Jim] I am. [looks at Angela] It's about the Save The Date.,Pam,Season 2,2x21
9011,"Pam, it wasn't her.",Jim,Season 2,2x21
9012,What?!,Pam,Season 2,2x21
9013,I'm the one who complained about you.,Jim,Season 2,2x21
9014,I... I didn't know that Toby was gonna write it down. [the camera flashes] I was just venting.,Jim,Season 2,2x21
9015,"[off camera] Okay, good. Check that out.",Michael,Season 2,2x21
9016,"You know, it was one day.",Jim,Season 2,2x21
9017,[off camera] That's terrible.,Michael,Season 2,2x21
9018,And I took it right back. It was like...,Jim,Season 2,2x21
9019,Okay.,Pam,Season 2,2x21
9021,"[off camera] Let's pay Mr. Price Gouger. [rejoins the group, on camera] Okay... we can do this. Come on, everybody. All right. Here we go. [flash goes off before he sits down]",Michael,Season 2,2x21
9022,It was really hard getting a good picture of fifteen people. He would not give me a good discount. And eight tries added up.,Michael,Season 2,2x21
9023,"[flashback the photo being taken] One, two..[flash goes off] Didn't say three, did I?",Michael,Season 2,2x21
9024,"But, I'm sort of an expert at Photoshop, so it turned out fine in the end. When people work together, there is going to be conflict. You can't outrun your problems.",Michael,Season 2,2x21
9025,"[on Pam's answering machine] Hey, Pam... it's Jim. Um, I have a doctor's appointment in the city. So I probably won't be in till the late afternoon. Just thought I'd let you know. Okay, bye. [camera shows Jim sitting on a waiting coach in another Dunder Mifflin office]",Jim,Season 2,2x21
9027,"Oh, thanks.",Jim,Season 2,2x21
9028,And that is why the idea of a cage match is so universally appealing. But here's the thing about cage matches: sometimes you have to open the cage. And that is something Toby will never understand.,Michael,Season 2,2x21
9029,[elevator bell dings] What is this? What happened here?,Dwight,Season 2,2x21
9030,I don't know.,Jim,Season 2,2x21
9031,"Oh, this does not look good. Did anyone see what happened around my desk area this morning?",Dwight,Season 2,2x21
9032,"Dwight, I really think someone's probably just playing a prank on you, so just go right through it.",Jim,Season 2,2x21
9033,"A prank, huh? This is official police line tape, okay? It's not a prank.",Dwight,Season 2,2x21
9034,Probably is.,Jim,Season 2,2x21
9035,"Damn it, people! Someone must have seen something! [Jim's cell phone beeping] Oh, you people are useless. Jesus.",Dwight,Season 2,2x21
9036,"[telephone ringing] Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Hold, please. Dwight, it's the Sheriff. He said that it's really important. It's regarding your desk. I'll transfer.",Pam,Season 2,2x21
9037,"Oh, no, no, don't! I can't... [groans] [telephone ringing]",Dwight,Season 2,2x21
9038,"Just cut through it, man, it's no big deal.",Jim,Season 2,2x21
9039,This is why I'm a Volunteer Sheriff's Deputy and you're not.,Dwight,Season 2,2x21
9040,"That is not why. Wow, man, he really wants to get in touch with you. Maybe it's a murder.",Jim,Season 2,2x21
9041,"No, there's no blood.",Dwight,Season 2,2x21
9042,Maybe poison?,Jim,Season 2,2x21
9043,Possibly.,Dwight,Season 2,2x21
9044,My God!,Jim,Season 2,2x21
9045,"[exclaiming in fear] No, Jim, no! [Jim knocks Dwight's phone off its cradle] [yelling toward the phone] Sheriff, this is Volunteer Sheriff's Deputy Dwight Schrute. Press the pound key! What's your 20?",Dwight,Season 2,2x21
9046,Nothing much is happening today. We are having our photo IDs taken. Whoop-de-doo. Can't always be like The Apprentice.,Michael,Season 2,2x21
9048,"On Big Brother, something important happens every day. But real life is not like that.",Michael,Season 2,2x21
9050,"He sometimes wears glasses, write that down. Also, that may not be his real hair.",Dwight,Season 2,2x21
9051,"I hate it when people don't tell each other why they're angry. My dad was like that. I would say, 'What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad?' Over and over and over. And he would just look at me like I was an idiot.",Michael,Season 2,2x21
9052,I'm the one who petitioned the office board to have these ID badges taken.,Dwight,Season 2,2x21
9054,Let me see your ID.,Dwight,Season 2,2x21
9055,"There is this old story about two women who each think they are the mother of this baby. And they can't decide, so they bring the baby to a wise man. Just like a manager in those days. And the wise man says, 'I will adopt this baby and raise it as a Hindu.' See? They didn't expect that. And that fixed it. Because I think he was the dad anyway.",Michael,Season 2,2x21
9056,"There are dozens of old complaints in here. Cold cases, like the show. [imitating gonging] And Toby is a lazy detective who has decided that these armed robberies and rapes and murder/suicides are not important enough to solve. Well, you know what? I have a problem with that. And I'm going to open up these cases before Toby can kill or rape another person.",Michael,Season 2,2x21
9058,"That's not bad. Hey, do you do weddings?",Pam,Season 2,2x21
9060,Not bad.,Jim,Season 2,2x21
9061,I gave her a higher clearance than you.,Dwight,Season 2,2x21
9062,What does Level Red mean?,Jim,Season 2,2x21
9063,"I'd tell you, but then I'd have to kill you. [laughing maniacally]",Dwight,Season 2,2x21
9067,Wow! I never thought Dwight would go postal. It's always the person you least expect and I always thought Dwight would go postal.,Michael,Season 2,2x21
9069,I'm done talking. I am a Schrute. We don't back down.,Dwight,Season 2,2x21
9071,"Cage Match'? I don't know if it was in the packet from corporate, because I barely read any of it. So if you're asking if I stole their idea, the answer is no.",Michael,Season 2,2x21
9073,"Yes, sir.",Dwight,Season 2,2x21
9076,"Thank you. [elevator door closes] No, come on... God!",Dwight,Season 2,2x21
9077,"Tonight the Scranton Business Park is having Casino Night and we are converting our warehouse into a full-blown gambling hall. And I know it's illegal in Pennsylvania, but it's for charity. And I consider myself a great philanderer. It's just... It's nice to know at the end of the day, I can look in the mirror and say, 'Michael, because of you, some little kid in the Congo has a belly full of rice this evening.' Makes you feel good.",Michael,Season 2,2x22
9078,Excuse me. How long is the wait for a table for two?,Jim,Season 2,2x22
9079,"I would never, ever serve you. Not in a million, billion years.",Dwight,Season 2,2x22
9080,It's a nice tux.,Pam,Season 2,2x22
9081,"I know. It belonged to my grandfather. He was buried in it, so family heirloom.",Dwight,Season 2,2x22
9083,"Come on, it'll be fun, and besides, I'm a roulette expert.",Pam,Season 2,2x22
9084,"Impossible. Roulette is not a game of skill, it is a game of chance.",Dwight,Season 2,2x22
9085,I can always kind of win at roulette.,Jim,Season 2,2x22
9086,"Oh, really? Mmm-hmm.",Dwight,Season 2,2x22
9087,Yeah.,Jim,Season 2,2x22
9088,How would you do that?,Dwight,Season 2,2x22
9089,Mind control.,Jim,Season 2,2x22
9090,[laughs] You can't be serious. Are you serious?,Dwight,Season 2,2x22
9091,"Ever since I was a little kid, like, eight or nine, I could sort of control things with my mind.",Jim,Season 2,2x22
9092,I don't believe you. Continue.,Dwight,Season 2,2x22
9093,"It was just little thing, you know, like I could make something shake or I could make a marble fall off the counter. You know, just little things.",Jim,Season 2,2x22
9094,"[scoffs] That's ridiculous. You know what? Uh... Why don't you move that coat rack? Excuse me, everyone! Attention in the office, please. Jim is about to prove his telekinetic powers and he needs absolute silence. Go ahead.",Dwight,Season 2,2x22
9095,"Okay, I'll try. [The coat rack wobbles] [Pam holds up an umbrella handle to the camera in another scene]",Jim,Season 2,2x22
9096,"Oh, my God.",Dwight,Season 2,2x22
9097,I try not to think of it as lagging behind. It's more of a David-and-Goliath thing.,Michael,Season 2,2x22
9099,Top 80 percent!,Michael,Season 2,2x22
9101,Yeah?,Michael,Season 2,2x22
9103,"Jan, listen, I promise that I will kick it up a notch. Bam!",Michael,Season 2,2x22

9511,"No.  No it's not.  I feel terrible about it.  I have been calling people 'faggie' since I was in junior high, and I have never made this mistake.  If I don't know how to behave, it is because I am just so far the opposite way, you know?  I'm just... I, I can't even imagine... the... thing.  Maybe we could go out for a beer sometime.

9531,"Well, he",Michael,Season 3,3x1
9532,"Well, he's not dressed in women's clothes, so...",Dwight,Season 3,3x1
9533,[deep sigh] There could be others...  I need to know.  I don't want to offend anybody else.,Michael,Season 3,3x1
9534,"You could assume everyone is, and not say anything offensive.",Dwight,Season 3,3x1
9535,"Yeah, I'm sure everyone would appreciate me treating them like they were gay.",Michael,Season 3,3x1
9536,"Hey, what about Angela?   She's hard and severe.  She could be a gay woman.",Michael,Season 3,3x1
9537,I really don't think so.,Dwight,Season 3,3x1
9538,"I don't know, I can imagine her with another woman, can't you?",Michael,Season 3,3x1
9539,[creepy smile],Dwight,Season 3,3x1
9540,Do some research.  Find out if there's a way to tell by just looking at them.,Michael,Season 3,3x1
9541,Jim told me you could buy gay-dar online.,Dwight,Season 3,3x1
9542,That's ridiculous.,Michael,Season 3,3x1
9543,Yeah probably.  He didn't tell the truth a lot.,Dwight,Season 3,3x1
9544,[sighs] Let's call him and get the website.,Michael,Season 3,3x1

9551,[loud sigh] Chicken.,Pam,Season 3,3x1
9553,"Excellent, thanks.",Pam,Season 3,3x1
9555,"Yeah, I didn't go through with the wedding.  I got cold feet, a few days before.  And I can't really explain it.  I just had to get out of that relationship.  We still had to pay for all the food.  So we froze it.  But I'm, I'm doing well.  I have my own apartment.  I'm taking art classes.  And I have lunch for the next five weeks.",Pam,Season 3,3x1
9563,"I watch the L Word.  I watch, Queer as F***, so...",Michael,Season 3,3x1
9566,What?  What does that even...,Michael,Season 3,3x1
9568,"Well, gay pride, right? Gay pride parade?  It's not like gay... shame festival.",Michael,Season 3,3x1
9570,I think Angela might be gay.  Could Oscar and Angela be having a gay affair?  Maybe!  Is that what this is about?,Michael,Season 3,3x1
9572,I don't kn--,Michael,Season 3,3x1
9574,Anything's possible.,Michael,Season 3,3x1
9576,"[laughs] Well, I'm not gay Jan, and you should know that better than anybody!",Michael,Season 3,3x1
9578,"The company has made it my responsibility today to put an end to 100,000 years of being weirded out by gays.",Michael,Season 3,3x1

9582,"Uh, Michael knows Pam.  He asked me to do this just for him.  He has his own reasons.",Dwight,Season 3,3x1
9583,"[looking at gay porn] Nothing wrong with this stuff.  At all.  This is fine.  You know what.  Gay porn, straight porn, it's all goooooood!  I don't particularly get into this.  But uh, you know what.  I totally see the merit!  And actually... it is quite beautiful.",Michael,Season 3,3x1

9589,"We're all homos!  Homosapiens.  Gays aren't necessarily who you think they are, people.  I mean anybody could be gay.  Business-men.  Like antique dealers, or hairdressers, or... accountants.  Oscar, why don't you take this opportunity to officially come out, to everybody here.  However you want to do it.  Go ahead.  Stand up.  I'm doing this for you.",Michael,Season 3,3x1
9592,Who should be the judges and juries of our society?,Michael,Season 3,3x1
9594,"Yes, that's a good point.  She has a good point.  Because gay marriage currently is not legal, under U.S. law.  I bet a lot of straight men wish that applied to them.  So they could go out there and have some torrid unabashed monkey sex as much as they could.  You know?  Sounds pretty good, right?",Michael,Season 3,3x1
9596,"I think all the other office gays should identify themselves, or I will do it for them.",Dwight,Season 3,3x1
9598,What about Phyllis?  She makes absolutely no attempt to be feminine!,Dwight,Season 3,3x1

9601,"But still, Phyllis, in college?  Did you ever experiment with other women?  A lot of women do!",Michael,Season 3,3x1
9603,[laughing] Right!  [serious] And I take that as a compliment.,Michael,Season 3,3x1
9605,"Well, I just like to look good OK, so ---",Michael,Season 3,3x1
9607,"No, I am just coming out myself.  I am coming out hetero!",Michael,Season 3,3x1
9609,No no no.  The only signal that I am sending is:,Michael,Season 3,3x1

9612,"You misunderstand-- OK.  You know what, OK.  I uh, I'm gonna put my money where my mouth is.  You ready?  I am going to embrace Oscar.  You might want to watch this Angela, because you can't catch anything.  Here we go.  We are going to make a statement.  You and I are going to make a statement together.  Oscar is my friend ---",Michael,Season 3,3x1
9614,"...and I just don't care who sees it, doesn't bother me!",Michael,Season 3,3x1

9620,"[embracing Oscar]You know what, I'm going to raise the stakes.  I want you to watch this.  And I want you to burn this into your brains.  Because this is an image that I want you people to remember for a long time to come.  Whenever you come into the office I want you to think about this.  [awkwardly kissing Oscar]  I did it.  See.  I'm still here.  We're all still here. [everyone claps]",Michael,Season 3,3x1
9621,"[Dwight gets up to kiss Oscar]  Oh come on!  Dwight!  Come on, man!",Michael,Season 3,3x1
9622,"We are not in the playground anymore.  There are new rules.  We have to be mature.  But we can't lose the spirit of child like wonder.  What is love...  anyway?  Maybe it's supposed to break all the rules.  Like me and Jan.  Or Oscar... and some guy.  Life is short.  When two people find each other, what should stand in their way?",Michael,Season 3,3x1
9623,"I am glad that today spurred social change.  That's part of my job as regional manager.  But you know what?  Even if it didn't, at least we put this matter to bed.  ...that's what she said.  Or he said.",Michael,Season 3,3x1
9624,"Oh, there's Gill.  Oscar's roommate.  I wonder if he knows?",Michael,Season 3,3x1

9666,What was Oprah about?,Pam,Season 3,3x2
9667,"Angelina Jolie was on. And she adopted a baby from Asia, and she said that it changed her life. And that really inspired me. So, I want you to look into seeing how much a little Chinese baby would cost.",Michael,Season 3,3x2
9668,That's a really big decision.,Pam,Season 3,3x2
9669,I know.,Michael,Season 3,3x2
9670,Maybe you should wait before you adopt.,Pam,Season 3,3x2
9671,Well...,Michael,Season 3,3x2
9672,Or not adopt.,Pam,Season 3,3x2
9673,"Just do it, okay?",Michael,Season 3,3x2
9674,"Roy's sister looked into it, and the application alone costs a thousand dollars.",Pam,Season 3,3x2

10252,"[leaving his desk for the day, pretends pull the pen out of a pretend grenade, and tosses it to Karen]",Jim,Season 3,3x3
10254,"Yep.  Yeah, we hugged it out.  But, it turns out, I was still a little angry.  So, I felt I needed to punish him, just a little bit more, [cut to Dwight standing on a box with 'LIAR' written on a piece of paper hung around his neck, Dwight's head hung in shame] and I'm making him do my laundry for a year.",Michael,Season 3,3x3

10404,And then we checked the fax machine.,Jim,Season 3,3x4
10407,"Oohh... can you imagine how much blood there was?  If it happened right here, it would reach all the way to reception.  Probably get on Pam.",Michael,Season 3,3x4
10409,What?,Michael,Season 3,3x4
10411,"Well, you know what?  I didn't wanna hear about it either, Stanley, but I did and now I can't stop picturing it.  He leaves work, he's on his way home... wham!  His cappa is detated from his head!",Michael,Season 3,3x4
10413,"Well, you know what?  There's something wrong with you.  There is something wrong with everybody in here.  Because we have lost a member of our family and you don't wanna talk about it, you don't wanna think about it, you just wanna get back to work!",Michael,Season 3,3x4
10414,"There are five stages to grief, which are [glancing at computer screen] denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance.  And right now, out there, they're all denying the fact that they're sad.  And that's   hard.  And it's making them all angry.  And it is my job to try to get them all the way through to acceptance.  And if not acceptance, then just depression.  If I can get them depressed, then I'll have done my job.",Michael,Season 3,3x4
10415,"I am going to throw you this ball.

Let me just start.  Let me show you how this works.   I catch the ball.  I lost Ed Truck.  And... it feels like somebody took my heart and dropped it into a bucket of boiling tears... and at the same time, somebody else is hitting my soul in the crotch with a frozen sledgehammer... and then a third guy walks in and starts punching me in the grief bone... and I'm crying, and nobody can hear me, because I am terribly, terribly... terribly alone.",Michael,Season 3,3x4
10417,"Okay, fine.  Hurry back.",Michael,Season 3,3x4
10419,Oh.  I would like a break.,Pam,Season 3,3x4

10428,You waited for me?,Pam,Season 3,3x4
10429,"Yeah.  Pam, you're a member of this family.  So we will wait for our family members. Phyllis, you wanna give it a shot?",Michael,Season 3,3x4
10430,"[grabbing ball] I got it.  When my mother was pregnant with me, they did an ultrasound and found she was having twins.  When they did another ultrasound a few weeks later, they discovered, that I had resorbed the other fetus.  Do I regret this?  No.  I believe his tissue has made me stronger.  I now have the strength of a grown man and a little baby.",Dwight,Season 3,3x4
10431,"Okay, why don't you throw the ball to somebody else.",Michael,Season 3,3x4
10433,"[returning ball to Stanley] Oh, yes Stanley.  Come on.  Your turn, you have to go.",Michael,Season 3,3x4
10435,Okay... I'm going to toss the ball to Pam.,Michael,Season 3,3x4
10436,"Let's see.  I had an aunt that I was really close to.  She was this amazing female boxer.  Um, anyway, she was injured in a fight, and she was paralyzed.  So, you can imagine how upset I was when I found out that she asked her manager to remove her breathing tube so she could die.",Pam,Season 3,3x4
10437,"Wow.  If you wanna cry, that's okay.",Michael,Season 3,3x4

10450,How do you know?,Michael,Season 3,3x4
10452,That that bird was dead?  Did you check its breathing?,Michael,Season 3,3x4
10454,"Was its heart beating, Toby?  Did you check it?  No, of course you didn't.  You're not a veterinarian.  You don't know ANYTHING! [runs out of conference room crying]",Michael,Season 3,3x4

10468,We don't know if it's dead.,Michael,Season 3,3x4
10470,You want me to flush him?,Dwight,Season 3,3x4
10471,Attention everybody.  This will only take a second of your time.  Today at 4 p.m. we will be meeting in the parking lot to have a funeral service for this bird.,Michael,Season 3,3x4
10473,"Well, I'm sorry to inconvenience you, Meredith.  But that is what you do when things die.  You honor them.  Toby killed this bird.  And now we are going to honor it.",Michael,Season 3,3x4
10475,"No, no, no!  That's enough!  You know what?  This bird is dead.  He died alone.  The least you can do is be there for him now. [to Dwight] Find a box for him.",Michael,Season 3,3x4

10488,"I'm sorry, I grew up on a farm.  We slaughtered a pig whenever we wanted bacon.  My grandfather was reburied in an old oil drum. [pause] It would have fit if he had given me another minute.",Dwight,Season 3,3x4
10489,I need a box.  I need a box.  A small box... not too confining.,Dwight,Season 3,3x4
10490,Is it for the bird?,Pam,Season 3,3x4
10491,Yeah.,Dwight,Season 3,3x4
10492,I have it covered. [hands Dwight a decorated box],Pam,Season 3,3x4

10494,If you wanna do something for the funeral...,Pam,Season 3,3x4
10495,"Yes, please.",Dwight,Season 3,3x4
10496,Maybe you could play a song on your recorder.,Pam,Season 3,3x4
10497,Excellent.,Dwight,Season 3,3x4
10498,Do you have it with you?,Pam,Season 3,3x4
10499,Always. [runs off],Dwight,Season 3,3x4
10500,Did I wake up this morning thinking I'd be throwing together a bird funeral?  You never can tell what your day here is  gonna turn into.,Pam,Season 3,3x4
10502,Where'd I find what?,Jim,Season 3,3x4
10503,"I called the manufacturer, who referred me to distributor, who referred me to the vending machine company, who told me that they sell them in the machines in the building next door.",Jim,Season 3,3x4

10507,"Actually, I have it.",Pam,Season 3,3x4
10508,You made this?  Wow. [impressed] That's... that's very nice.,Michael,Season 3,3x4
10510,I'd also like to say a few words if that's okay.,Pam,Season 3,3x4
10511,Yes.,Michael,Season 3,3x4
10512,"What do we know about this bird?  You might think, 'Not much.  It's just a bird.'  But we do know some things.  We know it was a local bird.  Maybe it's that same bird that surprised Oscar that one morning with a special present from above.",Pam,Season 3,3x4
10514,"And we know how he died.  Flying into the glass doors.  But you know what?  I don't think he was being stupid.  I think he just really, really wanted to come inside our building to spread his cheer and lift our spirits with a song.",Pam,Season 3,3x4
10515,He's not a songbird.,Dwight,Season 3,3x4
10516,Shhh.,Michael,Season 3,3x4
10517,"An impression, then.  Lastly, we can't help but notice that he was by himself when he died, but of course, we all know that doesn't mean he was alone.  Because I'm sure that there were lots of other birds out there who cared for him very much.  He will not be forgotten.",Pam,Season 3,3x4

10524,Umm... sure.,Jim,Season 3,3x4
10526,[chuckles] He's so cute.,Jim,Season 3,3x4
10528,"That's okay. [Hannah shows pic of husband naked with baby] Oh, no, it's not. I'm sorry, is that your husband in the tub with him?",Jim,Season 3,3x4
10530,Sounds good.,Jim,Season 3,3x4
10532,"Oh, wow. He...",Michael,Season 3,3x4
10534,Does his family know?,Michael,Season 3,3x4
10536,But I'm the first in the office?,Michael,Season 3,3x4
10538,"Okay, yes, sure, I will do that...",Michael,Season 3,3x4
10540,"...'Cause I'm the first to to find out. Nobody else knows and it is my responsibility to tell them. Well, good. How are you holding up? Want me to come over? [Jan hangs up]",Michael,Season 3,3x4
10541,"Ed Truck died. And it blows. They say that with grief, time makes it worse, which is bad for me because I found out before anybody so I've had more time to be sad.",Michael,Season 3,3x4
10542,"Attention, everyone. As you know, Ed Truck is dead. If you have any contact information on Rolodex files or in Microsoft Outlook, remove it now. Also, if you have any photographs, Pam will make her shredder available during lunch. That is all.",Dwight,Season 3,3x4
10543,"Remembering the dead doesn't help anybody. The way to best honor them is to figure out what killed them and prevent that thing from killing anyone ever again. In this case, some sort of steel exoskeleton to protect the neck, or else a device that allows the head to live separately from the body. I'm working on both.",Dwight,Season 3,3x4
10544,"I would like you all to clear your schedules this afternoon, because I am telling corporate to send in a grief counselor. We need to find out what is blocking you. And that way, we'll be able to honor Ed the way he deserves to be honored. May he rest in peace.",Michael,Season 3,3x4
10546,"What was that, Kevin?",Michael,Season 3,3x4
10548,"No, you said something, didn't you?",Michael,Season 3,3x4
10550,You think that's funny.,Michael,Season 3,3x4
10552,You are disgusting.,Michael,Season 3,3x4
10553,"Michael, no need to call corporate. We are supposed to use Toby. He's trained as a grief counselor.",Dwight,Season 3,3x4
10554,"No, that can't be right.",Michael,Season 3,3x4
10556,"Well, then I guess that makes you about the worst grief counselor in the world, doesn't it?",Michael,Season 3,3x4
10558,Hi.,Pam,Season 3,3x4
10560,"Well, I will be spending the entire afternoon in grief counseling for someone I've never met.",Pam,Season 3,3x4
10562,"Closer to the epicenter, I guess.",Pam,Season 3,3x4
10566,"You're ruining it, already. They should not be given the choice.",Michael,Season 3,3x4
10573,"Wow. Wow. No. No. You are the most heartless, soulless person I've ever met.",Michael,Season 3,3x4
10575,"No. No. Shh. Enough. It is going to take me hours to undo all the damage that your have done here. Dwight, Ryan, I want you to take the table out. We're gonna go on a five minute break, and when you come back, we're going to start with a clean slate, and, in the interim, I would like you to forget everything that Toby has said, okay?",Michael,Season 3,3x4
10576,"I don't think I'm overstating it when I say that Toby is a plague on this company. And he is worthless. You give people a chance to shine and they blow it, just like you knew they would. Grief counseling is not about, 'Are you hungry? Would you like a sandwich?' These people are so far gone, you have to stick a food tube down their throats.",Michael,Season 3,3x4
10577,"Okay, part of the problem was that Toby talked at you. Now, I am going to talk with you. First off, I want you to be comfortable, because you really can't grieve if you're all tight and buttoned up. So, guys, loosen your ties, just take your jackets off if you want. Ladies, let your hair down. You know what? Even take your shoes off. I wanna get personal and I want you all to really open up. And I want you to know that anything and everything can be said.",Michael,Season 3,3x4
10580,"I found an exercise in Toby's binder that he managed to miss, that involves screening the part of you that says, 'I don't wanna do that. I don't wanna talk about that. That is too private.' Here's how it works. I'm going to throw you this ball.",Michael,Season 3,3x4
10583,Really?,Pam,Season 3,3x4
10585,"Wow, I thought that was supposed to be, like, next month.",Pam,Season 3,3x4
10587,"Yeah, I'd love to see them. Oh, and tell them I say, 'Congratulations.'",Pam,Season 3,3x4
10589,I should probably head back in.,Pam,Season 3,3x4

10595,"That's... Hold it, hold it, hold it. Start, like, right in there. [Dwight digs hole in ground] Just dig.",Michael,Season 3,3x4
10596,Ow! God!,Dwight,Season 3,3x4
10597,"Okay, give it to me. You don't know what you're doing. All right. [Michael starts digging]",Michael,Season 3,3x4
10599,"Nothing. Let's just... all right. [talks to warehouse guys] Guys, do you have a box we could use?",Michael,Season 3,3x4
10600,Brain teaser. I have two coins totaling 15 cents and one of them is not a nickel. What are they?,Dwight,Season 3,3x5
10602,"No, I said one of them is not a nickel.",Dwight,Season 3,3x5

10612,Uhhh... nothing.,Michael,Season 3,3x5
10614,"Yeah, nothing. How was your day?",Michael,Season 3,3x5
10616,"Wow. Well. Ok. I don't care how your day was either, Jan. I was just asking you because you asked me. Why do you set me up like that?",Michael,Season 3,3x5
10618,I worked. And then I went home to my condo. And Carol came over. And then we had sex. Is that what you want to hear?,Michael,Season 3,3x5
10619,"Never ever, ever sleep with your boss. I am so lucky that Jan and I only got to second base.",Michael,Season 3,3x5
10621,Hi.,Pam,Season 3,3x5
10623,"Oh, I don't know if I'm...",Pam,Season 3,3x5

10626,So you excited?,Dwight,Season 3,3x5
10628,Very excited?,Dwight,Season 3,3x5
10630,Extremely excited? ... Just very?  That's cool.,Dwight,Season 3,3x5
10632,"I am very excited. Ryan hasn't made a sale yet, but more importantly, he hasn't made an ally yet. Is he going to be a slacker-loser-wise-ass like Jim was? Or is he going to join the Dwight Army of Champions?",Dwight,Season 3,3x5
10634,"When you are ready to see the sales office, the sales office will present itself to you. Your journey begins now.",Dwight,Season 3,3x5
10636,What?,Jim,Season 3,3x5

10694,Great! I thought you could use this time to authorize some checks.,Pam,Season 3,3x5
10695,I thought that maybe you could wait in line for me while I go to the bathroom. You're an angel.,Michael,Season 3,3x5
10696,"Hey, why don't you just go up to your office, get some work done, and I'll just bring you a pretzel.",Pam,Season 3,3x5

10699,"Pam, productivity starts with patience and determination. I'll be back.",Michael,Season 3,3x5
10700,It is time for your next test. You have planted the beet seed. You have walked the long lonely walk of loneliness.,Dwight,Season 3,3x5
10702,You know what your problem is? You know why you haven't made any sales? Cause you think you know everything. You have to trust that maybe there are other people that can teach you things. Are you ready to learn? Are you ready for the final test?,Dwight,Season 3,3x5
10704,Come on!,Dwight,Season 3,3x5
10706,Hi. Please tell me that you have a sweet pretzel left.,Michael,Season 3,3x5

10721,Wrong. Flash floods. What is the true cause of Robert Mifflin's suicide?,Dwight,Season 3,3x5
10723,Wrong. He hated himself. What is the DHARMA initiative?,Dwight,Season 3,3x5
10732,"Final question, young Ryan Howard. What is Michael Scott's greatest fear?",Dwight,Season 3,3x5
10734,"Wrong. He's not afraid of anything. Also, I would have accepted snakes. Fear is what it's all about. You cannot sell while undergoing fear. You need to vanquish fear! One must wrestle fear to the ground. You will now wrestle my cousin Mose.",Dwight,Season 3,3x5
10736,Wrestle him to the ground.,Dwight,Season 3,3x5

10747,Establish time frames. Keep the phrase 'real dollars' in their head. And always keep the power in the conversation. That's why you're losing them on the cold calls. Cause you say the word please too much.,Dwight,Season 3,3x5
10749,"Michael always said, K.I.S.S. Keep it simple, stupid. Great advice, hurts my feelings every time.",Dwight,Season 3,3x5

10768,They did not. They didn't have to say it to your face.,Dwight,Season 3,3x5
10770,"Not everything's a lesson, Ryan. Sometimes you just fail. It's those online paper jerks. The whole business is changing. You know what?

Come on! Drive.",Dwight,Season 3,3x5

10939,Wha? Really? You should! It's fun.,Michael,Season 3,3x6
10940,"I love the people here. And if there was one thing I di... don't really care for is that they can be terribly, terribly ignorant about other cultures. And I don't want them embarrassing me in front of my girlfriend, Carol.",Michael,Season 3,3x6
10941,"Diwali is a very important holiday for the Hindus. But, frankly, I'm a little appalled that none of you know very much about Indian culture. So, without further ado, Kelly you are on.",Michael,Season 3,3x6
10943,Kelly?,Michael,Season 3,3x6
10945,Um... why don't you tell us a little bit about the origins of the holiday.,Michael,Season 3,3x6
10951,"Pam wishes. [generalized laughing] Kelly, I'll take this one. Diwali is a Celebration of the Coronation of the God-King Rama. After his epic battle with Ravana, the Demon King of Lanka. It symbolizes the battle between good and evil...",Dwight,Season 3,3x6
10952,"All right, all right, all right, all right. This isn't 'Lord of the Rings'.",Michael,Season 3,3x6
10953,Sorry.,Jim,Season 3,3x6

10956,Thank you.,Jim,Season 3,3x6
10957,"Now, a lot of people say that Kelly is one in a million and that's true, but it's also not true. Because, frankly, there are literally billions of people just like Kelly in the world.

10968,Wow.,Jim,Season 3,3x6
10970,Yup.,Jim,Season 3,3x6
10971,And another thing about the Indian people... they love sex positions. I present to you the Kama Sutra. I mean look at that. Who's seen that before?,Michael,Season 3,3x6

10997,[points at woman] What does that look like to you?,Michael,Season 3,3x6

11019,Very official.,Pam,Season 3,3x6
11020,"I decided to come. Uh... I feel a little under-dressed... but at least I'm not dressed like a slutty cheerleader, right? Is that mean?",Pam,Season 3,3x6

I would like you to do me the honor of making me your husband.",Michael,Season 3,3x6
11047,What do you say?,Michael,Season 3,3x6

11296,What does that mean?,Jim,Season 3,3x7
11302,"Okay, this is it. [runs up the stairs of CFO's house, with Dwight] This is exactly what Michael Moore does, famous documentarian. He goes up to people with a camera and he's like 'Why did you do this? Why did you pollute? You are bad. You're a bad person.' It's very dramatic.  Although, I can't say I was a big fan of  'Bowling for Columbine', because I thought it was going to be a bowling movie, like 'Kingpin'. And it wasn't. It was something else.",Michael,Season 3,3x7

11323,Yes? What is the meaning of this?,Dwight,Season 3,3x7

11326,"Yes, but these are employees, Sir. These are human beings.",Michael,Season 3,3x7

11386,I really don't know.  How you doing with all this?,Jim,Season 3,3x7
11388,You'd actually move to Scranton?,Jim,Season 3,3x7
11390,New York City is 45 minutes down the road from here. And you wanna  move to Scranton? I dunno. If I were you I'd move to New York?,Jim,Season 3,3x7
11396,Anything?,Michael,Season 3,3x7
11397,Nothing. [puts down binoculars],Dwight,Season 3,3x7
11398,What if this doesn't work? What is the office actually goes under?,Michael,Season 3,3x7
11399,Then it was an honor to have worked with you.,Dwight,Season 3,3x7
11400,"[pats Dwight and sighs] All right, favorite moments in Dunder-Mifflin history. Go.",Michael,Season 3,3x7
11401,My first day when you hazed me by spraying me with a fire extinguisher.,Dwight,Season 3,3x7
11402,That was hilarious. The foam ...,Michael,Season 3,3x7
11403,"Uh,... my first sale, my promotion to assistant regional manager, our basketball game, when you took me to the hospital, and told me that you cared about me.",Dwight,Season 3,3x7

11424,Yeah.,Pam,Season 3,3x7
11426,"Yeah, me too.",Pam,Season 3,3x7
11427,"Maybe this is good. Finding another job is a pain. There's another annoying boss, another desk, I'd have to learn everything all over again. So, there are reasons to stay.",Pam,Season 3,3x7
11428,"Hey, um, I think I am gonna take that job. And Scranton... it's not that bad. So, if they offer you a job there, I think you should take it.",Jim,Season 3,3x7
11430,Okay.,Jim,Season 3,3x7
11432,What are we still doing here? It's over. Let's go home. Get the car.,Michael,Season 3,3x7
11433,[picks up his beeping cell phone],Dwight,Season 3,3x7
11434,"Oh, this was such a stupid idea! This was so stupid. I am such a stupid idiot. I let everybody down. Everybody hates me. I lost everybody's jobs. Nobody likes me anymore!",Michael,Season 3,3x7

11448,I don't ... have no idea.,Dwight,Season 3,3x7
11449,I don't understand.,Michael,Season 3,3x7
11451,The Stamford branch is closing and everybody's just packing up their stuff. Andy Bernard made these tasteful hats.,Jim,Season 3,3x8
11453,Yeah.,Jim,Season 3,3x8
11455,You know what? I think you just need to meet him.,Jim,Season 3,3x8
11457,Sounds good Andy.,Jim,Season 3,3x8
11459,"Yes. This is going to be very interesting. All right, I'm out of here. See you later?",Jim,Season 3,3x8
11462,Hey!,Pam,Season 3,3x8
11464,How'd the run go?,Pam,Season 3,3x8
11466,That's great!,Pam,Season 3,3x8
11467,"Psh, why is that great?",Dwight,Season 3,3x8
11468,Because he accomplished something.,Pam,Season 3,3x8
11469,What was your mile time?,Dwight,Season 3,3x8
11471,[scoffs] I could beat that on a skateboard.,Dwight,Season 3,3x8
11473,"Yeah, well my feet don't. And I can still crush that time.",Dwight,Season 3,3x8
11474,"Really, Dwight? How fast are you?",Pam,Season 3,3x8
11475,Let's just put it this way. Last weekend I outran a black pepper snake.,Dwight,Season 3,3x8
11476,Really?,Pam,Season 3,3x8
11477,I am fast. To give you a reference point. I'm somewhere between a snake and a mongoose. And a panther.,Dwight,Season 3,3x8

11486,I can't... [starts running],Dwight,Season 3,3x8
11487,"Am I being mean to Dwight? I don't know. I did just make him run around the building and I have no intention of timing him. This isn't even a stopwatch. It's a digital thermometer. He does make my life harder, sometimes. And on purpose. Like he tried to put meters on the bathroom stalls as a way of bringing in more money for the company. [yells to Dwight] Hey, three more laps to go. Gotta pick it up if you're going to beat Toby.",Pam,Season 3,3x8
11488,Aaaaah!,Dwight,Season 3,3x8
11489,I should probably get back to work.,Pam,Season 3,3x8

11496,Okay.,Michael,Season 3,3x8
11497,"My branch is absorbing the Stamford branch. Or, as I like to put it, my family is doubling in size. That's all I'm going to say about it because I have a gigantic performance ahead of me. And I have to get into my head and focus. [exhales]",Michael,Season 3,3x8
11498,Who's next?,Michael,Season 3,3x8

11508,I'm not firing somebody on the first day.,Michael,Season 3,3x8
11509,"No, no, no! Not somebody. Gardner.",Dwight,Season 3,3x8
11510,The Japanese camp guards of World War II always chose one man to kill whenever a batch of new prisoners arrived. I always wondered how they chose the man who was to die. I think I would have been good at choosing the person.,Dwight,Season 3,3x8
11511,Good morning!,Pam,Season 3,3x8
11512,"Got the food? Good! Looky-looky-looky. What I want you to do... set it up in the conference room, please. Make it look nice. As if you are trying to impress a much older man who's way out of your league.",Michael,Season 3,3x8
11513,Okay.,Pam,Season 3,3x8
11514,"Yes! I'm in a good mood today! I'm excited to meet all the new people and to see my old friend again, definitely. That's always a thing that makes people happy... to have an old friend back.",Pam,Season 3,3x8
11516,Ah! Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding. Our first arrival. Welcome to Scranton. This is Hannah Smoterich-Barr.,Michael,Season 3,3x8

11602,My title has 'Manager' in it.,Dwight,Season 3,3x8

11627,[talking to himself] I present the orientation video.,Michael,Season 3,3x8
11628,We need to talk!,Dwight,Season 3,3x8
11629,Not now.,Michael,Season 3,3x8
11630,Which is higher? Assistant Regional Manager or Regional Director in Charge of Sales?,Dwight,Season 3,3x8
11631,I told you the titles are irrelevant. They just relate to pay scale.,Michael,Season 3,3x8
11632,Okay. So who gets paid more? Me or Andy?,Dwight,Season 3,3x8
11633,"It is not a matter of more or less. Your pay is just different. Okay? All right! Show time, part one.",Michael,Season 3,3x8
11634,Ok. Who reports to who?,Dwight,Season 3,3x8
11635,"I don't care! Dwight! You all report to me! That's all that matters! The rest of it just work out amongst yourselves, ok?",Michael,Season 3,3x8
11636,And then if I want...,Dwight,Season 3,3x8
11637,Work it out amongst your selves!,Michael,Season 3,3x8

11651,"Okay. Everybody settled in? Good. Why don't we all proceed in to the conference room? Or, should I say, the banquet hall. For... drum roll, please [makes drum roll noises], the official Merger Day All-Family Welcome Breakfast. Come on in!",Michael,Season 3,3x8
11652,Yoko shack.,Michael,Season 3,3x8
11655,"Nope, no. Guests only.",Michael,Season 3,3x8
11657,"Nope. Um... for the guests it is. For you, consider it cow-meat. Strictly taboo.",Michael,Season 3,3x8
11659,"Well, then... consider it poisoned beef. No touchy.",Michael,Season 3,3x8
11661,"No, it's not beef... just... sit down, please. [talks to group] Welcome. Help yourself.",Michael,Season 3,3x8
11663,"Wrong. Toby, this is an orientation not a borientation.[talks to group] Okay. Do not worry. All of your questions are about to be answered. Cell phones and pagers off, please.",Michael,Season 3,3x8
11664,"Oh, this looks promising.",Jim,Season 3,3x8
11665,You won't be disappointed.,Pam,Season 3,3x8
11666,Let's face it. Moving to a new job can be very stressful. So I have made an orientation video especially for you newcomers. But it's not like any orientation video that any of you have ever seen. It's funny. It's got a little bit of a zing to it and I hope that it gives you a flavor of what we're all about here at Dunder Mifflin. And what we're all about here in Scranton. So let's just all laugh together and watch 'Lazy Scranton'.,Michael,Season 3,3x8
11668,"Sittin' in my office with a plate of grilled bacon, call my man Dwight just to see what was shakin'.",Michael,Season 3,3x8
11669,"Yo Mike, our town is dope and pretty.",Dwight,Season 3,3x8
11670,So check out how we live,Michael,Season 3,3x8

11674,The Electric City. Scranton.,Michael,Season 3,3x8
11675,What?,Dwight,Season 3,3x8
11676,The Electric City. Call poison control if you're bit by a spider.,Michael,Season 3,3x8
11677,But check that it's covered by your health care provider!,Dwight,Season 3,3x8
11678,It reminds me of the orientation video showed on my first day. 'The Scranton Witch Project'.,Jim,Season 3,3x8
11679,[in video] I am so scared... when people don't label their personal food.,Michael,Season 3,3x8
11681,"You like coal mines and you wanna see 'em, Well, check it out, yo, the Anthracite Museum! Plenty of space in the parking lot,",Michael,Season 3,3x8
11682,But the little cars go in the compact spot,Dwight,Season 3,3x8
11684,[on video in background] Spot. Scranton. What? The Electric City. Scranton.What? The Electric City. Scranton. What?,Michael,Season 3,3x8
11685,"Well, so far, I think it is killin'. I thought it would either be an 'A' or an 'A+' but I completely forgot that there's an 'A++'.",Michael,Season 3,3x8
11687,Terrible. Totally unconvincing.,Jim,Season 3,3x8
11689,"Not bad, but you are Italian so... try it more Italian.",Jim,Season 3,3x8
11691,You feel good?,Jim,Season 3,3x8
11693,All right.,Jim,Season 3,3x8
11696,Do you mean to me? From you? Cause that's how it works.,Dwight,Season 3,3x8

11710,Oh. You've changed so much.,Pam,Season 3,3x8
11711,"Well, I'm evolving, Pam.",Jim,Season 3,3x8
11712,So when do I get to hear everything? Are you still getting unpacked or... you want to grab a coffee or something after work?,Pam,Season 3,3x8
11713,"Oh! Um... tonight, actually? No. I'm uh just still getting settled.",Jim,Season 3,3x8
11714,"Oh, yeah, no! You know. Whenever.",Pam,Season 3,3x8

11723,All right!,Jim,Season 3,3x8
11724,"The day's going fine. It's been a little chaotic but it's fine. It's great! A lot of distractions. But, it's good.",Pam,Season 3,3x8
11729,What is that? A squid's eye or...,Michael,Season 3,3x8
11731,How did you...,Michael,Season 3,3x8
11746,People hate people that are different from them. That's natural. But you know what makes people forget their differences?  A great show. That is why I created the 'Integration Celebration'. This is the moment when Scranton and Stamford come together as one. United in applause.,Michael,Season 3,3x8
11747,"I know what a lot of you must be thinking. 'Wow! What a day! Feels more like a night at a party than a day at work.' Well, in my opinion, business should feel like a night out. A night... at... the Roxbury. Okay. There's supposed to be music and it's... I got it, I got it! I got it. Dwight! Just.",Michael,Season 3,3x8
11748,Do you have batteries?,Dwight,Season 3,3x8

12205,Prison Mike. What's the very very worst thing about prison?,Dwight,Season 3,3x9
12207,"The worst thing about prison was the... was the Dementors. They... were flying all over the place, and they were scary. And they'd come down, and they'd suck the soul out of your body, and it hurt!",Michael,Season 3,3x9
12209,"No, not Harry Potter. ... There are no movies in prison. This is my point! You guys got it soft, and cushy! This place is freaking awesome! The people are awesome! Your boss is nice!

12212,"Okay. Okay, fine. You guys think prison is so great? All right. Well, here you go. [locks employees in conference room]",Michael,Season 3,3x9
12213,"Okay, Michael. Come on. Let us out.",Jim,Season 3,3x9
12214,"No! If you think is prison is so wonderful, then, enjoy prison! They are such babies. I am going to leave them in there until they can appreciate what it's like to have freedom. And if this doesn't bother them, then I am out of ideas.",Michael,Season 3,3x9
12219,"They were very disrespectful to me, and to the office. And Martin has had a bad influence, to think that I gave him the benefit of the doubt.",Michael,Season 3,3x9

12244,"He was already dead. And we Schrutes use every part of the goose. The meat has a delicious, smoky, rich flavor. Plus you can use the molten goose grease and save it in the refrigerator, thus saving you a trip to the store for a can of expensive goose grease.",Dwight,Season 3,3x10
12245,Wow. Win-Win.,Jim,Season 3,3x10
12246,"Exactly. Thank you, Jim.",Dwight,Season 3,3x10

12307,And next to your kids. What?,Michael,Season 3,3x10
12309,I don't understand?,Michael,Season 3,3x10

12325,What?,Jim,Season 3,3x10
12326,For the past few months I've been sending Dwight letters from the CIA. [hands a folder to Jim],Pam,Season 3,3x10
12327,Are you serious?,Jim,Season 3,3x10
12328,"They're considering him for a top secret mission. There's his application. Oh, and this is where I made him list every secret he promised he'd never ever tell.",Pam,Season 3,3x10

12357,"Like maybe, the real reason they left was because there were things they wanted you to do in bed, that were, foreign, and scary?",Michael,Season 3,3x10
12358,"Well.. um I, I don't...",Pam,Season 3,3x10
12359,And not that you didn't want to try them. Some wine may have helped. Do you know what I'm referring to?,Michael,Season 3,3x10

12991,"Michael sends me a postcard from every vacation he goes on. Atlantic City, he wishes I was here. Busch Gardens, Virginia, all I got was this lousy postcard.

13020,"Okay, let me tell you a little story. When I was on vacation, I met a man named Bavon. And Bavon takes people parasailing. And you know what he said to me? He said that he loves going to work every day. How many of you can say that you love going to work every day like Bavon? [Dwight and Andy raises hand] No one.",Michael,Season 3,3x11
13022,"His name is Bavon. And you know what? I'm sure Bavon gets sick of his job, too. I'm sure he would like to take a day off.

13384,What does that even mean? That is impossible.,Michael,Season 3,3x13

13432,"No, no, no. I mean, not because you're gay. Your gayness does not define you. Your Mexican-ness is what defines you to me. And I think we should celebrate Oscar's Mexicanity. So Phyllis... I want you to go find firecrackers. And a Chihuahua. Pam, in the frozen food section, Swanson makes a delightful chimichanga.",Michael,Season 3,3x13

13446,Fine. Party pooper.,Jim,Season 3,3x13
13447,Who's that sportscaster that bit that lady? Marv something? Andy is like Marv Something. Great sportscaster. Big weirdo creep.,Michael,Season 3,3x13
13449,"Hey, Ryan?",Jim,Season 3,3x13
13451,You wanna pull a prank on Andy?,Jim,Season 3,3x13
13453,I liked you better when you were the temp.,Jim,Season 3,3x13
13455,Hey guys. How's the workload on all of Dwight's old accounts? Handling it okay?,Michael,Season 3,3x13

13495,You know what?  Maybe it's in the ceiling.,Jim,Season 3,3x13
13497,Okay.,Jim,Season 3,3x13
13500,Why would Dwight do that for you? I think I know why. Because Dwight loves this company.,Michael,Season 3,3x13

13517,What's up?,Michael,Season 3,3x13
13518,Same old.,Dwight,Season 3,3x13
13519,Um. It takes a big man to admit his mistake. And I am that big man. Angela from accounting told me what you did.,Michael,Season 3,3x13
13520,"Oh my God, she told you?",Dwight,Season 3,3x13
13521,"Yes, she did. And Dwight, if you were willing to do something like that for some random co-worker, then clearly I have misjudged you from the beginning, and I apologize.",Michael,Season 3,3x13

13537,Ladies and gentlemen! May I present... Mr. Dwight Schrute!,Michael,Season 3,3x13
13540,Thank you.,Dwight,Season 3,3x13
13541,"Okay, Dwight, you can let go of her hand. You're gonna break it. [looks around the room] Not bad, huh?",Michael,Season 3,3x13

13558,"Oh, man. [Kevin starts to put a blindfold on] No, no, no. I don't need it. Get out! [beats up pinata]",Dwight,Season 3,3x13
13559,It takes a big man to admit his mistake and that's what I did. The important thing is I learned something. I don't want somebody sucking up to me because they think I'm going to help their career. I want them sucking up to me because they genuinely love me. Hmm.,Michael,Season 3,3x13
13567,"Hello son.  If you're watching this, that means I'm already dead.  Life is a road---",Michael,Season 3,3x14

15098,"Yeah... you are... ah, so right.  They had visual aids.  And all we had were the facts.  You don't go to the science museum and get handed a pamphlet on electricity.

15110,"You may be asking yourself, 'What am I doing on a trampoline?'  Well, I thought I'd bounce here for a while, relieve some stress, and then move on with my day.  Not!  Here's the plan.  Dwight, is going to gather all of the office workers and all of the warehouse guys, we're going to have another safety seminar.  Only this time, where's Michael?  Oh my God!  He is on the roof!  Now I have got their attention.  I... tell them, about the cold hard facts of depression.  And then I say, 'Hey!  You ever seen a suicide?'  And I jump.  And they freak out.  And they get to see... the dangers of depression with their own eyes.  Nice side note: They might think 'Hey, I should have been nicer to Michael.'  But that's... not why I'm doing this... Then, I land on the trampoline, take a couple extra bounces for fun.  I climb off, walk around the corner... Ta-freakin'-da!  [Dwight nods]",Michael,Season 3,3x19

Magazines and TV shows and movies portray women as skinny, tall goddesses. Well, look around. Are women like that? No. No, they are not. [points to Pam] Even the hot ones aren't really that skinny. So what does that say? That says that you women are up against it. And it is criminal. Society doesn't care. Society sucks. I don't even consider myself a part of society. FYI. Because I am so angry over all of this.",Michael,Season 3,3x21

15865,"Ye - OK, yes.",Michael,Season 3,3x21
15867,"You're right. You're right, you're right. And you know why? It's because of where we are. This is a masculine environment. We need to find a place where you feel comfortable. You know where we're gonna go? The Steamtown Mall. [Kelly gasps]",Michael,Season 3,3x21
15870,"OK, let's go, ladies of Dunder-Mifflin. Hey, we should have a calendar printed up. Pam, put that in my good idea folder. [Pam nods] Let's go!",Michael,Season 3,3x21

15889,Go crazy.,Jim,Season 3,3x21
15892,"Of course you do, moon face. That's because you're a preppy freak, you're the office pariah, and nobody likes you. So start hanging these all around the building.",Dwight,Season 3,3x21
15894,"No, duh. That's why we gotta catch him. Start hanging those.",Dwight,Season 3,3x21

16193,"Smart as a whip! Yes! [holds up hot dog packages] These are pre-cooked, so it's not absolutely necessary, but I would appreciate it if you could heat up 800 hot dogs for a little contest I'm going to be having. I would greatly appreciate it.",Michael,Season 3,3x22

16294,You do not have what it takes to be a regional manager.,Michael,Season 3,3x22
16295,That's harsh.,Jim,Season 3,3x22
16296,Who's next? Andy? Where's Andy? Andy is never here today.,Michael,Season 3,3x22
16299,Because I already did. Remember? I burned my foot on a George Foreman grill.,Michael,Season 3,3x22

16320,"Aggggh, that stings!",Dwight,Season 3,3x22
16321,"Being the boss is also about image.  I've never looked like that. That was gross. I just, I don't see the connection between a firewalk and management. Worst seventy-five bucks I ever spent.

Michael, you couldn't even do that.  Maybe I should be your boss? Wow, I feel really good right now.  Why didn't any of you come to my art show? I invited all of you.  That really sucked. It's like sometimes some of you act like I don't even exist.  [turns and looks directly at Jim] Jim, I called off my wedding because of you. And now we're not even friends.  And things are just like weird between us, and that sucks. And I miss you. You were my best friend before you went to Stamford, and I really miss you. I shouldn't have been with Roy. And there were a lot of reasons to call off my wedding. But the truth is, I didn't care about any of those reasons until I met you.  And now you're with someone else. And that's... fine. It's... whatever. That's not what... I'm not... Okay, my feet really hurt. The thing that I'm just trying to say to you, Jim... and to everyone else in this circle I guess, is that I miss having fun with you. Just you, not everyone in the circle.

16469,"Thanks, Pam.",Jim,Season 3,3x23
16470,"After I had my little outburst at the beach, Jim was really nice about it. He just basically said that he missed my friendship too and I would always mean a lot to him and I understand where he's coming from.  For the record, I am not embarassed at all. It needed to be said, and I said it, and it only took me three years to summons the courage, so [quietly, and mock bowing] thank you.",Pam,Season 3,3x23
16471,[knock on door] Yeah.,Michael,Season 3,3x23

16492,Why so you can do it?,Michael,Season 3,3x23
16494,Whoops.,Jim,Season 3,3x23
16495,"No, um, well I was thinking that uh, actually we could all leave tomorrow and do a convoy you know?  Convoys are really fun.  Pull up next to each other, give each other the finger...",Michael,Season 3,3x23

16533,"No, no, no. You know what? It's a done deal. I basically have the job already. There's nothing she can do to stop it now. I already sold my condo.",Michael,Season 3,3x23

16541,I have to buy another place.,Michael,Season 3,3x23

16563,Eighty thousand dollars a year.,Dwight,Season 3,3x23
16564,Once I'm officially Regional Manager my first order of business will be to demote Jim Halpert. So I will need a new number two.  My ideal choice? Jack Bauer. But he is unavailable. Fictional. And overqualified.,Dwight,Season 3,3x23

16618,You're so much happier now. Just go in there and be strong.,Pam,Season 3,3x23

16625,"Jan is in a different place right now, and it is a sign of maturity to give people second chances. So I am going to hear her out.",Michael,Season 3,3x23
16626,Oh my God. [mouths to Jim],Pam,Season 3,3x23
16627,"Yeah, bigger actually.",Jim,Season 3,3x23
16628,[whispers] That's crazy!,Pam,Season 3,3x23
16629,Mm-hm.,Jim,Season 3,3x23
16630,[mouths] Wow!,Pam,Season 3,3x23
16632,Unbelievable.,Jim,Season 3,3x23
16634,She could put the cup right there.,Jim,Season 3,3x23
16636,"No, it's fine.  I'm sure it must have been weird for Jim when Roy and I were joking around... that",Pam,Season 3,3x23
16641,Yeah.,Michael,Season 3,3x23
16643,First got priorities.,Michael,Season 3,3x23
16645,Let's get back together. [Jan smiles and laughs],Michael,Season 3,3x23

16654,Thanks.,Jim,Season 3,3x23
16655,"I'm happy for him.  I hope he gets the job.  I really just want him to be happy.  And I know that sounds cliche.  And I know saying it sounds cliche, sounds cliche...  Maybe I'm being cliche.  I don't care.  Cause I am what I am. [thinks] That's Popeye.",Pam,Season 3,3x23
16656,I am going to begin this process with a simple test of intelligence and mental dexterity.  What is the best color?,Dwight,Season 3,3x23

16660,What is the capital of Maine?,Dwight,Season 3,3x23
16662,"Okay, also, moratorium on Cornell talk.  Don't wanna hear about it.  Forget your personal history, and learn the history of this company.",Dwight,Season 3,3x23
16664,"You're not off to a very good start, Bernard.",Dwight,Season 3,3x23
16667,"[Andy and Dwight arm-wrestle, Andy is about to win] Time! No, you failed.",Dwight,Season 3,3x23

16685,"So, I guess we're getting back together.",Michael,Season 3,3x23
16686,What happened?,Pam,Season 3,3x23
16687,"Your advice was good, but Jan's was bigger.",Michael,Season 3,3x23
16688,"Here's the sitch. Two weeks ago, I was in the worst relationship of my life.  She treated me poorly.  We didn't connect, I was miserable. Now, I'm in the best relationship of my life with the same woman.  Love is a mystery.",Michael,Season 3,3x23

16692,"Um, everytime my sixth grade class has a field trip.",Jim,Season 3,3x23

16699,Oh do you mean when I get the job?,Jim,Season 3,3x23

16704,[exhales] How are you guys doing?  Need anything?,Michael,Season 3,3x23

16713,"I am by far the most qualified person they're interviewing.  Jim and Karen are here, which is cute.  They're like, kid actors tagging along with daddy, on the big audition, hoping to be discovered.  Except daddy... is the best actor around.  Daddy is Meryl Streep.",Michael,Season 3,3x23

16730,Thank you.,Pam,Season 3,3x23
16731,"I had to make Andy my number two.  It's political, complicated, you wouldn't understand.  I want you... to be Assistant Regional Manager.",Dwight,Season 3,3x23
16732,Really?,Pam,Season 3,3x23
16733,"Well, in a sense.  Although, publicly I am going to retain the Assistant Regional Manager position.",Dwight,Season 3,3x23
16734,You will be your own assistant.,Pam,Season 3,3x23

16744,Good to see you.  Here are the post-merger performance stats that you asked for.,Michael,Season 3,3x23

16762,"Excellent question, Pam.  1/100th of a cent.",Dwight,Season 3,3x23
16764,Just... zip your lid!  Another announcement.  Michael wasted an enormous amount of the group's time and patience with non-work related ethnic celebrations and parades of soft-minded dogoodedness.  No longer.  No more meetings!,Dwight,Season 3,3x23
16766,"Instead, today I will begin my first lecture in a long series of lectures designed to increase your knowledge on the world of paper.",Dwight,Season 3,3x23

16769,I literally cannot wait to see what Dwight has planned.  And I wish Jim were here.,Pam,Season 3,3x23
16771,"I've never been a big fan of the name Dunder Mifflin.  I was thinking we could name the company something like, 'Paper Great.  Where great paper is our passion.  We're GRRRRRRRRRREAT!'

16781,"I don't understand. So, we're gonna tag team it?",Michael,Season 3,3x23

16785,Trees!  And where do trees grow?,Dwight,Season 3,3x23
16787,"Soil. Right.  We have, in front of you here, seven different types of Pennsylvania top soil.  Now, what would you say... is the most important element in the production of above ground leafy growth?  Probably phosphorus, right? [Angela smiles, shakes her head 'no']  Wrong!  It's nitrogen!  Absorb this information.  Good!  Now, let us discuss precipitation.  Stanley!  When rainfall occurs, does it usually fall in a liquid, solid, or gaseous... state?",Dwight,Season 3,3x23
16789,Very good!  You have earned one Schrute Buck.,Dwight,Season 3,3x23

16822,Cool.  Maybe you should do it sooner rather than later.,Michael,Season 3,3x23
16824,"Daaah, let's just run away together.  Let's just run away to Jamaica and live in a bungalow.  You have some savings right?  You could pay off my debts.  It would... be fine.  We'd have fun.",Michael,Season 3,3x23
16826,I can't tell you.,Michael,Season 3,3x23

16850,"It's so intimidating!  Anyone who comes in here... is gonna have to take me seriously.  Abandon all hope, ye who enter here!",Dwight,Season 3,3x23
16857,"So, I am gonna... give her a ride home.  Let me know about the job.",Michael,Season 3,3x23
16859,"Good, I'm glad we're on the same page.  I have a lot of ideas for new directions.",Michael,Season 3,3x23
16861,"You know what?  That... is actually good... because, um, I don't think I could take... my girlfriend's job.  That's not being a good boyfriend.  So, I respectfully withdraw my name from consideration.  Do you accept my withdrawal?",Michael,Season 3,3x23
16863,"Good.  Very good.  I'm glad we are finally on the same page.  Still have my job in Scranton, though.",Michael,Season 3,3x23

17185,"As a farmer, I know that when an animal is sick, sometimes the right thing to do is to put it out of its misery. With the electricity we're using to keep Meredith alive we could power a small fan for 2 days. You tell me what's unethical.",Dwight,Season 4,4x1

17213,"Turns out Meredith has been exposed to rabies. Which is like 10 times worse than a little crack in your pelvis. Thanks to me she went to the hospital and I saved her life. Curse is broken. Curse is broken people! [Kevin claps] Oh... there is a God, and he has a plan for us after all. So go home get some rest, very very good work today. We got a lot accomplished.",Michael,Season 4,4x1

17216,"[Pam's car pulls out of parking lot and then off to the side of the road] I told you I'm not dating anyone. And even if I was, I don't think it's anyone's business. I mean, when I do fall in love, like when it's for real, the last person I'm gonna talk about it too is a camera crew, or my co-workers. [Jim gets into the passenger side] Almost marrying Roy Anderson was as close to Pamela Anderson as I ever want to be.

17220,"A woman shouldn't have to be hit by a car, to learn that she may have rabies. But that is where we are in America. And that does not sit right with me. And that is why I'm hosting a fun run race for the cure for rabies. To raise awareness of the fact that there is a cure for rabies. A disease that has largely been eradicated in the US. But not very many people know that.",Michael,Season 4,4x1
17222,"Hi Stanley, how many sponsors so far?",Michael,Season 4,4x1
17224,"Come on man, gotta step it up! It's for a good cause. Jan called this morning and pledged $500.00.",Michael,Season 4,4x1
17226,"That... is for a good cause. Phyllis, how's the rabies quilt coming?",Michael,Season 4,4x1

17234,"Alright, alright.",Michael,Season 4,4x1
17236,Shhh...,Michael,Season 4,4x1
17238,I know that you're probably scared of people seeing your fat legs in shorts.,Michael,Season 4,4x1
17240,"OK, well back in olden times, a large fat person, like this, was a person of power. A person who had money, could buy food, person of respect. Like the regional manager of the day. Whereas, someone athletic and trim, like myself, was someone who worked in the fields... And I was a peasant.",Michael,Season 4,4x1
17242,"Well, you're going to have to run, or you're going to be in a lot of trouble. It is not olden times anymore.",Michael,Season 4,4x1

17258,Well I'm gonna start fast.,Pam,Season 4,4x1
17259,Mm-hmm.,Jim,Season 4,4x1
17260,Then I'm gonna run fast in the middle.,Pam,Season 4,4x1
17261,What?,Jim,Season 4,4x1
17262,Then I'm gonna end fast.,Pam,Season 4,4x1
17263,Why won't more people do that? [laughs],Jim,Season 4,4x1
17264,Cause they're just stupid.,Pam,Season 4,4x1
17265,[looks at camera] What?,Jim,Season 4,4x1
17266,"[Pam and Jim watch video of their kiss on the tv] Oh, ah... No that's not... I mean that wasn't, ah...",Jim,Season 4,4x1
17267,Yeah... That was um...,Pam,Season 4,4x1
17268,"I mean I can see how it would seem a bit like we uh... How it looks like um... I mean now a days you can edit anything, right? I mean you can edit anything to look like um... anything.",Jim,Season 4,4x1
17269,"Yeah, I gave him a ride home because...",Pam,Season 4,4x1
17270,Right!,Jim,Season 4,4x1
17271,... We're dating.,Pam,Season 4,4x1
17272,Wow! There it is.,Jim,Season 4,4x1
17273,"Ah, yeah. We haven't told anybody, but it's going really great. [looks at Jim] Right?",Pam,Season 4,4x1
17274,It is going really great.,Jim,Season 4,4x1

17281,"We have raised, almost $700.00, most of it from me and Jan. Um... when do they put that on the giant check? Or is that something that we write in later?",Michael,Season 4,4x1
17282,"Well a giant check costs about $200.00 to make up. I have a print shop standing by but... What do you think Michael, that's over 25% of our funds?",Pam,Season 4,4x1
17283,Hmm... That's a tough decision. Um... I always imagined it with a giant check. So...,Michael,Season 4,4x1
17284,"Yeah, I mean I personally am definitely on board for the giant check.",Jim,Season 4,4x1
17285,Giant check it is.,Pam,Season 4,4x1
17286,Yeah.,Jim,Season 4,4x1
17287,Yep.,Michael,Season 4,4x1
17288,"Well I don't know, on the other hand it does leave less money for bat birth control.",Dwight,Season 4,4x1
17289,Bat birth control,Jim,Season 4,4x1
17290,"Wait, this money is going to bat birth control, right Michael, that's what you told me when I contributed.",Dwight,Season 4,4x1
17291,You didn't contribute very much. I was also hoping to hand the giant check to a rabies doctor. And how's that been going?,Michael,Season 4,4x1
17292,"Not well. A doctor won't come out to collect a check for $700.00, or $500.00 if we go with the giant check.",Pam,Season 4,4x1
17293,Which we are.,Jim,Season 4,4x1
17294,And also there is no such thing as a rabies doctor.,Pam,Season 4,4x1
17295,What about a rabies nurse?,Michael,Season 4,4x1
17296,I don't think so.,Pam,Season 4,4x1
17297,"You know what though, I've actually seen ads for nurses that you can hire by the hour, for parties and bachelor events.",Jim,Season 4,4x1
17298,That's possible. Look into that.,Michael,Season 4,4x1
17299,"Great, it's gonna cost a couple a hundred buck and ah... oh actually more with tips.",Jim,Season 4,4x1
17300,Maybe we should just skip the ceremony and setup a college fund for Meredith's son.,Dwight,Season 4,4x1
17301,Have you met that kid? He's not going to college.,Michael,Season 4,4x1
17302,"Michael, 5k means 5 kilometers, not 5 thousand miles. [knocks]",Pam,Season 4,4x1

17309,"No I didn't, just please don't...",Michael,Season 4,4x1

17314,Eww.,Jim,Season 4,4x1

17317,[Michael knocks slowly on door] Come in.,Pam,Season 4,4x1
17318,May I enter the room?,Michael,Season 4,4x1
17319,Yes. Or come in.,Pam,Season 4,4x1
17320,See how I did that. That's the way you should enter a room. You knock and then you wait for the all clear.,Michael,Season 4,4x1
17321,You couldn't have taken off all your clothes in the men's room?,Jim,Season 4,4x1
17322,"Yes, but I have an office, so why would I do that.",Michael,Season 4,4x1
17323,"On average, how many hours a day do you spend naked in your office? Just ballpark.",Pam,Season 4,4x1
17324,European offices are naked all the time.,Michael,Season 4,4x1
17325,They're so not.,Pam,Season 4,4x1
17326,Besides my shirt tail covered most of it so...,Michael,Season 4,4x1
17327,I didn't see where it started but I saw where it ended.,Pam,Season 4,4x1
17328,[sighs] Gross.,Jim,Season 4,4x1
17329,"That's not gross, it is the human body. What is your problem? Pam you're an artist, right? Think of me as one of your models. OK, you know what, I don't want this to detract from what we really need to be thinking about today, it's not fair to people with rabies. And that's the point, right? OK, let's go have some fun.",Michael,Season 4,4x1
17330,Alright.,Jim,Season 4,4x1
17331,They say if you're nervous around someone you should picture them naked. I do not recommend this strategy. Try picturing them with more clothes on... or a funny coat.,Pam,Season 4,4x1
17332,"[naked from chest up] Oh, I'm sorry, is this a working office, and not a French beach?",Jim,Season 4,4x1
17339,"Check that out. [points to Toby] Look at me, I'm Toby, I'm stretching, I know what I'm doing. Why is he even here?",Michael,Season 4,4x1
17341,"What? Look, no it was not...",Pam,Season 4,4x1
17343,"OK everybody, listen up. Thank you for coming. Before we get started I wanted to say a few words about this deadly disease called rabies. And I'd like you to take a look into the face of rabies. [turns around a picture of Meredith in the hospital] That should scare you. It scares me. You people need to educate yourselves. Myth: 3 Americans every year die from rabies. Fact: 4 Americans every year die from rabies. How many of you know someone who has been afflicted or affected by rabies? Show of hands. One, two, three... too many to count. It is truly the silent killer. No, it is the foaming barking killer. And it is something... Darryl what are you doing.",Michael,Season 4,4x1
17345,"No, don't give him... just, did you hear anything I said?",Michael,Season 4,4x1
17347,"He's happy because he's insane. You know what, that's the perfect example of the kind of awareness we need to generate. Where's the nurse? [Elizabeth walks up in nurse's outfit] This is the reason we're here.",Michael,Season 4,4x1
17349,"Oh hey, I know you... Elizabeth?",Michael,Season 4,4x1
17351,"Right? Wow, very cool you went back and got your degree. I would like you to accept this check, for $340.00 made out to science. Make sure that, that gets into the right hands.",Michael,Season 4,4x1

17367,"Oh, would you look at that.",Jim,Season 4,4x1
17368,Darn it.,Pam,Season 4,4x1
17370,"No, no water for me. Not while rabies causes fear of water... solidarity!",Michael,Season 4,4x1
17372,Rabies victims... have to live with an irrational hatred of water their entire lives. So... least I could do.,Michael,Season 4,4x1
17380,That fettuccine is sitting in my stomach like a rock.,Michael,Season 4,4x1

17385,I don't know I'm really committed to winning.,Pam,Season 4,4x1

17387,Mmm... Yes.,Pam,Season 4,4x1
17388,That's what I thought.,Jim,Season 4,4x1
17389,Yeah.,Pam,Season 4,4x1
17390,Right. Let's do some good.,Jim,Season 4,4x1

17403,"I... I sang her, her favorite songs.",Dwight,Season 4,4x1
17405,It was beautiful and gentle and respectful. I fed her antihistamines and she gradually fell asleep.,Dwight,Season 4,4x1

17423,"Oh, and I get to carry it.",Jim,Season 4,4x1
17429,"[bent over] I am not going to finish. I can't beat rabies. Nobody can beat rabies, rabies has been around for a thousand years. I was a fool to think that I could beat it. [Creed,Stanley, and Oscar pass by in the cab and get out at the finish line]",Michael,Season 4,4x1
17430,...talk about it.,Jim,Season 4,4x1
17431,"Yeah probably. Hey, Michael?",Pam,Season 4,4x1
17432,"What are you doing here? Did you come back for us, or...",Jim,Season 4,4x1

17434,"Well, you're probably dehydrated.",Jim,Season 4,4x1
17435,What do you want me to do Jim?,Michael,Season 4,4x1
17436,Glass of water would be a start.,Jim,Season 4,4x1
17437,"No, There are people all over the world, who have all sorts of problems and afflictions, and diseases. They're deformed, and they're abnormal, and... they're illiterate and ugly. Symphonies don't have any money. Public TV is bust. I can't do anything about it, I can't... you know. There's just one of me, and there's a thousand of them. And rabies wins.",Michael,Season 4,4x1
17438,Wow! You are a downer. We were having a pretty nice day.,Jim,Season 4,4x1
17439,I'm still having a nice day.,Pam,Season 4,4x1

17442,That's a good deal.,Michael,Season 4,4x1
17443,"And Michael, you don't have rabies. And chances are you're not going to get it anytime soon. So... you don't really have to think about it too much.",Pam,Season 4,4x1
17444,"Pam, if everybody felt that way, nothing would get done.",Michael,Season 4,4x1
17445,"Yeah, but there's other, better people out there who are helping.",Pam,Season 4,4x1
17446,"You just don't think I am capable, of making a difference.",Michael,Season 4,4x1
17447,"I know you Michael, I saw you naked.",Pam,Season 4,4x1
17448,"You don't, you don't know me. You've just seen my penis. I can make a difference, remember, I'm the one who started this whole thing off by hitting Meredith with my car. And I owe it to her to finish this... GD 5k [gets up groaning, Jim tries to help] No, no!",Michael,Season 4,4x1
17449,"Finishing that 5k, was the hardest thing I have ever had to do. I ate more fettuccine alfredo and drank less water, than I have in my entire life. People always talk about triumphs of the human spirit, well today I had a triumph of the human body. That's why everybody was applauding for me at the end. My guts and my heart, and while I eventually puked my guts out, I never puked my heart out. And I'm very, very proud of that.",Michael,Season 4,4x1
17451,Hey Mer. How ya doing?,Michael,Season 4,4x1
17453,"It's ironic isn't it? I mean I'm in the hospital for not getting enough water, and you're in it for a disease that causes the fear of water.",Michael,Season 4,4x1
17455,"Thanks, I'm not mad at you anymore. [sighs, takes sucker out of his mouth] Wanna share?",Michael,Season 4,4x1
17457,"I'm not really sick. [Meredith takes a lick and hands back to Michael] Nah, I'm good.",Michael,Season 4,4x1
17458,Did you ever think of this?  Would a sober person walk in front of a car?,Michael,Season 4,4x1
17460,"I'm sorry, are you saying that Meredith was drunk at 9 AM?",Jim,Season 4,4x1
17461,Well...,Michael,Season 4,4x1

17466,That's not...,Michael,Season 4,4x1
17468,"That's not what...no, no, I'm not saying that, that's disgusting.",Michael,Season 4,4x1
17471,I am saying... that... maybe I was drunk.  Did you ever think of that?,Michael,Season 4,4x1
17472,Definitely not.,Jim,Season 4,4x1
17475,Okay.,Michael,Season 4,4x1
17476,Maybe she hit me.  You ever think of that?  She hit me?  I don't know whose fault it was.  I wasn't exactly looking at the road.,Michael,Season 4,4x1
17477,"Hey, Toby. [walks past him to Kelly's cubicle]",Pam,Season 4,4x1

17487,"Hey! Okay, okay, okay,    You can just close that.",Michael,Season 4,4x1
17490,"Let's just... Why can't you just forgive... Why, why are you having such a hard time laughing this off?  How do you know that you weren't born with some sort of abnormal pelvis that it was just bound to crack at some point?",Michael,Season 4,4x1
17492,I'm not going to leave until you forgive me.,Michael,Season 4,4x1

17501,"On the one hand, it's a relief to know that it's not just me, the whole office is cursed.  On the other hand, I may have to deal with the dark unknown.",Michael,Season 4,4x1

17509,"Oh.  Great.  We have a secular humanist here, that is disgusting.",Michael,Season 4,4x1
17511,Yes.  It is a philosophy which says people can improve their lives by using reason instead of religion or superstition.,Michael,Season 4,4x1

17514,"My cousin Mose's best friend was a dog.  One day, he was foaming at the mouth, so I had to shoot him dead.  Turns out, he had only eaten one of Mose's cream pies.  Did I feel bad for killing him?  No.  That's how you deal with a thief.",Dwight,Season 4,4x1
17515,"Yeah, the, uh, the charity's having some financial problems.  What do I look like to you, Paul Newman?  That's actually not a good example, because I have been compared to a young Paul Newman, my eyes and my face.  And I make my own salad dressing.  I mix Newman's Ranch with Newman's Italian.  Sell it at flea markets for a slight loss.  I could make... I could make a profit if I changed one of the ingredients to Wishbone [shakes head] but I won't do it.",Michael,Season 4,4x1

17545,"Is this about me and Jan? In my office? Because I will have you know that that was consensual. What we did has nothing to do with you or anyone here. I don't think. I don't think anyone heard anything. We were very discreet and, and most people had left by that point. So I don't think it's any of your business. What I think you should do is roll up the memo, real tight...",Michael,Season 4,4x2

17561,"Actually, we've been dating for a couple months.",Jim,Season 4,4x2
17562,"I love you guys, so much. [hugs Jim]",Michael,Season 4,4x2

17571,"No. [tries to hide piece of paper, but Pam grabs it]",Michael,Season 4,4x2
17572,[reading from paper] Can you make that straighter? That job looks hard. You should put your mouth on that. How can you even use that one naturally?,Pam,Season 4,4x2

17574,You might want to trim it a little.,Pam,Season 4,4x2
17577,"Yeah, he is.",Pam,Season 4,4x2

17583,It's a feral barn cat. I trapped him last night and I'm giving him to you as a replacement cat for the one I destroyed.,Dwight,Season 4,4x2
17585,And his name is... Garbage. Mose calls him Garbage because he likes to eat garbage. [shakes cat] Don't you Garbage? [makes chomping noises],Dwight,Season 4,4x2
17587,You haven't buried her yet?,Dwight,Season 4,4x2

17637,"Sounds good. OK, alright.",Michael,Season 4,4x2
17638,"Yeah, Ryan snapped at me, but there was this twinkle in his eye that I picked up on, which said, 'Dude, we're friends. I'm doing this for appearances. I am the big boss now. And I have to seem like an ogre. But you know me and you trust me. And we like each other. And we'll always be friends. And I would never take you for granted in a million years. And I miss you, man. And I love you.' His words.",Michael,Season 4,4x2
17640,"Wait a second. Last time I checked, Dunder Mifflin already has a website. And quite frankly, I'm not really sure what's wrong with it. [Jim at his desk, showing the Dunder Mifflin website reading 'Under Construction. Coming Christmas 2002!']",Jim,Season 4,4x2
17642,"OOhh. Gimmme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.",Michael,Season 4,4x2

17659,I am not old. You are old. You are like a hundred.,Michael,Season 4,4x2

17670,"Oh no, we're just sitting here.",Jim,Season 4,4x2
17672,OK.,Pam,Season 4,4x2
17674,OK.,Jim,Season 4,4x2
17675,And... that is why we waited so long to tell people.,Jim,Season 4,4x2
17677,"Yeah, kay. I was just... After the presentation, just wanted to make sure, that vis-a-vie, that everything in the office is business as usual?",Michael,Season 4,4x2
17679,"Yeah, I know I understand... we're making great strides and we're updating, but business as usual, no?",Michael,Season 4,4x2
17681,"Good, so, we're on the same page?",Michael,Season 4,4x2
17683,"We had a foreign exchange student live with us when I was young. And we called him my brother. And that's who I thought he was. Um, then he went home to what is now formerly Yugoslavia, taking all of my blue jeans with him. And I had to spend the entire winter in shorts. That is what Ryan is like. A fake brother who steals your jeans.",Michael,Season 4,4x2
17707,Hello.,Dwight,Season 4,4x2
17709,Really?,Dwight,Season 4,4x2
17711,"I'll make a reservation. No, no. Let me cook for you. Cauliflower and noodles. Baked potato on the side.",Dwight,Season 4,4x2
17714,Hi.,Pam,Season 4,4x2
17716,In his office. You can go right in.,Pam,Season 4,4x2

17734,I don't want to grow weird sperm in case we ever want to have kids.,Michael,Season 4,4x2
17736,"Oh, I dunno, they're launching a big new business plan. New website, blah blah blah. He's being a real twerp about it, so, it's all about youth, and agility and streamlining and trying to squeeze out the older people.",Michael,Season 4,4x2
17738,Well...,Michael,Season 4,4x2
17740,What is that... word?,Michael,Season 4,4x2
17742,So older people have just as many rights as younger people?,Michael,Season 4,4x2
17750,Michael told us to wait in here. We don't know why.,Pam,Season 4,4x2

17754,Have a seat.,Michael,Season 4,4x2
17756,Have a seat. Like everybody else.,Michael,Season 4,4x2
17758,"Still my office, Ryan. [Ryan sits down] Well, there has been a lot of talk about new ideas today. Well, new ideas are fine, but they are also... illegal, because they are a form of ageism. What? Yes, I am right. Did you know that the Age Discrimination and Employment Act of 1967 prohibits employment discrimination based on age with respect to employees 40 years of age or older? I did.",Michael,Season 4,4x2
17760,"Hey, shut up Toby. Look, why do we as a society hate old people so much?",Michael,Season 4,4x2
17762,"No, Creed, no they are not. In fact, many cultures revere old people because of their storytelling ability. Like the old lady from Titanic. [points to her picture on the wall] Or the funny things that they can do, like 'where's the Beef?' [points to another picture on wall] [Jim raises his hand] Yeah.",Michael,Season 4,4x2
17763,"Why do you have the Big picture up again? You used that already, when you burned your foot.",Jim,Season 4,4x2

17766,Oh. [man enters conference room],Pam,Season 4,4x2
17768,"[puts hand up] That is me. Come on in. [They shake hands] Who is this old fart? Did you just stagger off the street? Out of a box or something? Who's this worthless bag of bones? Well, this guy is none other than one of the founders of Dunder Mifflin, Mr. Robert Dunder. Huh? [starts clapping, others join in]",Michael,Season 4,4x2
17769,"Oh, yeah. Yes!",Dwight,Season 4,4x2
17772,Sure thing. [both go out of conference room] 'Scuse me. [closes door],Michael,Season 4,4x2
17774,Fine. Then I will call David Wallace and you can explain to him why you threw the founder of the company out on his ancient butt. [they glare at each other],Michael,Season 4,4x2
17775,"Bob, how old are you?",Michael,Season 4,4x2
17777,"Eighty-seven years young. And still active. That is great. Did you know, that Bob is still a member of the Board of Dunder Mifflin?",Michael,Season 4,4x2
17779,"Ah, still sends his own proxy. Good for you.",Michael,Season 4,4x2
17780,"I'm gonna live for a very long time. My grandma Schrute lived to be 101. My grandpa Manheim is 103, and still puttering around in Argentina. I tried to go visit him once, but my travel visa was protested by the Shoah Foundation.",Dwight,Season 4,4x2
17782,Wow.,Michael,Season 4,4x2

17792,Perfect. [starts closing the door],Michael,Season 4,4x2
17794,"Inspirational. What have we learned?  Well, we have learned that you can't teach an old dog new tricks, because it's illegal, and you will go to jail. [Pam raises hand]",Michael,Season 4,4x2
17795,I think that I should help him get home.,Pam,Season 4,4x2
17796,"No, No. Don't help him. He doesn't need help, Pam. [Jim nods head and Pam gets up and leaves to help Robert Dunder, Michael shows Robert thumbs up] What a nice guy.",Michael,Season 4,4x2
17797,Good night guys. [staff leaves the office],Michael,Season 4,4x2
17799,"I disagree, I think it was very valuable.",Michael,Season 4,4x2
17801,I happen to think the old ways of doing business are better. And I can prove it.,Michael,Season 4,4x2

17832,Smell that. Do you smell that?,Michael,Season 4,4x2
17833,Dry rot?,Dwight,Season 4,4x2
17834,"No, Dwight. That smells like good business to me. What I have done here is I have collected all the finest gourmet items that Scranton has to offer.",Michael,Season 4,4x2
17836,"Yes, no! No, those are for our clients. Actually, our exclients. I'll explain, later.",Michael,Season 4,4x2
17837,"Ryan wants everything in our company to be about emails and IM's, but I think he's forgetting about the original instant message. Letters attatched to baskets of food.",Michael,Season 4,4x2

17864,Be honest.,Jim,Season 4,4x2
17865,I now find you repulsive.,Pam,Season 4,4x2
17866,"That's honest. [sighs] Alright, fair enough. It was really fun while it lasted though, wasn't it?",Jim,Season 4,4x2
17867,Eh...,Pam,Season 4,4x2
17868,"For me, it was.",Jim,Season 4,4x2

17870,Alright.,Jim,Season 4,4x2
17871,"Hey boss, I didn't know you were coming in today.",Michael,Season 4,4x2
17873,"I am glad that you asked, listen up everybody. In the last year, we have lost seven clients to the big chains. These gift baskets are our ticket back into their lives. We are going to show up at these businesses unannounced, and we are going to win them back.",Michael,Season 4,4x2

17876,"Ever since I was a kid people have been telling me I can't do things. 'You can't be on the team', 'You can't move on to second grade'. Well, now they're telling me that I can't win back clients using old fashioned business methods. [shakes head] We'll see about that. And FYI, I eventually aced second grade, and I was the biggest kid in class.",Michael,Season 4,4x2
17877,"OK. We're gonna split up into teams. Jim, Phyllis. Stanley, Dwight. Me Andy.",Michael,Season 4,4x2
17881,Why don't we just go by ourselves?,Jim,Season 4,4x2
17882,Why don't we just go as teams to demonstrate our teamsmanship?,Michael,Season 4,4x2
17884,Yes?,Michael,Season 4,4x2
17886,"OK, that's not helpful Phyllis.",Michael,Season 4,4x2
17888,"Gift baskets are amazing, Phyllis. Gift baskets are... the essence of class and fanciness. They are the ultimate present that a person can recieve.",Michael,Season 4,4x2
17890,What about a gift basket full of cash?,Jim,Season 4,4x2
17892,"Fine, I'm just going to go by myself, and I am going to win them back by myself because this is important to me. [walks toward the door]",Michael,Season 4,4x2

17905,"[in Michael's car] Sweet ride, American made. What happened to the Sebring?",Dwight,Season 4,4x2
17906,It is in the body shop. Had to have the dent taken out of the hood where I hit Meredith.,Michael,Season 4,4x2

17948,[driving] That guy was so... how can they not know how much better we are?,Michael,Season 4,4x2
17949,I don't know. Sometimes people are just impossible and they make you miserable.,Dwight,Season 4,4x2
17950,That is true.,Michael,Season 4,4x2
17951,Like Angela in accounting.,Dwight,Season 4,4x2
17952,"Yes, she is nuts.",Michael,Season 4,4x2
17953,"Ugh... no, she's wonderful... at accounting. But she drives me crazy.",Dwight,Season 4,4x2

17965,"And the last guy says 'No, hairy body'.",Michael,Season 4,4x2

17969,"She's gonna be like eleven this winter? Wow, they grow up so fast. I have a few of my own that I want some day.

17981,No it's not.,Michael,Season 4,4x2
17983,"Accept it, why would he come back?",Dwight,Season 4,4x2
17984,"Why would he come back? I will tell you, Dwight. He would come back because we offer a wide selection of products and because you're definitely not getting the same sort of customer service that you get with us.",Michael,Season 4,4x2
17985,That's not gonna change his mind. He's moving on. We had our chance and we killed it.,Dwight,Season 4,4x2
17986,"Look... we're also coming out with a website soon. It's a state of the art thing, it'll be up and running, it's gonna cut costs and it will make ordering much much easier.",Michael,Season 4,4x2
17988,"Great, the magic of the gift basket.",Michael,Season 4,4x2

18527,"No!  I'm an adult, I don't have to think or do anything.  You're a kid, a little snot-nosed, punk kid who thinks he's better than everyone else, because he's some hot shot, and you don't know anything about sales.  So stop being a disrespectful little jerk, okay?",Michael,Season 4,4x3

19157,Mmm-uh-mm [incoherent mumbling],Dwight,Season 4,4x4
19158,"Yeah, I mean she was with Roy, and, uh, I just couldn't take it.  I mean, I lost it Dwight.  I couldn't sleep, I couldn't concentrate on anything.  Even weird stuff, like food had no taste.  So my solution was to move away.  It was awful.  It was something that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy, and that includes you.",Jim,Season 4,4x4
19159,"[sobbing, reaches out to Jim after he walked away]",Dwight,Season 4,4x4
19160,"Hey, I was thinking about dinner--- [Jim grabs her face and kisses her]",Pam,Season 4,4x4
19161,"Ah, dinner.  Let's see, maybe we should try the new Italian place, where the drive-in used to be.",Jim,Season 4,4x4
19162,Okay.,Pam,Season 4,4x4
19163,Yeah?,Jim,Season 4,4x4

19176,I'm out of answers Jan.,Michael,Season 4,4x4

19197,"Do you think I'll get any new ones?  I could... [pause, eventually looks up at Dwight]",Michael,Season 4,4x4

19199,"What do you mean, 'what'?",Michael,Season 4,4x4
19200,What... [mumbling],Dwight,Season 4,4x4
19201,Were you listening to what I was saying?,Michael,Season 4,4x4
19202,I was aware that you were speaking.,Dwight,Season 4,4x4
19203,What is the matter with you?,Michael,Season 4,4x4
19204,What is the matter with... me?,Dwight,Season 4,4x4
19205,Yeah.,Michael,Season 4,4x4
19206,I'm... discombobulated.,Dwight,Season 4,4x4

19225,I can't go back to that.,Michael,Season 4,4x4

19245,That is impossible.  Unless you mean gonorrhea.,Dwight,Season 4,4x4
19247,"Yes, I did, 'cept I don't think she means it.  Angela is in a great deal of pain because of the death of her cat, and she's in a kind of a grieving process, and it makes her say things.  So... best to just lay off.",Dwight,Season 4,4x4
19249,"Oh my God, you do have gonorrhea.",Jim,Season 4,4x4

19303,"We are making a commercial for Dunder Mifflin today. Our first ad ever.

19331,Now this gentleman right here is the key to our urban vibe.,Michael,Season 4,4x5
19333,Stanley is hilarious. Phyllis is like our Mrs. Butterworth. Kind of a less urban Aunt Jemima.,Michael,Season 4,4x5
19334,"These are our accountants. And as you can see they are very different sizes. What you might want to do is kind of a Papa Bear, Mama Bear, Baby Bear thing. That might be kind of fun.",Michael,Season 4,4x5
19336,Who else?,Michael,Season 4,4x5
19337,"I think it's great that the company's making a commercial because not very many people have heard of us. I mean, when I tell people that I work at Dunder Mifflin, they think that we sell mufflers, or muffins, or mittens, or... And frankly all of those sound better than paper, so I let it slide.",Jim,Season 4,4x5
19338,You playing that game again?,Jim,Season 4,4x5
19339,"Second Life is not a game. It is a multi-user virtual environment. It doesn't have points or scores, it doesn't have winners or losers.",Dwight,Season 4,4x5
19340,Oh it has losers.,Jim,Season 4,4x5
19341,I signed up for Second Life about a year ago. Back then my life was so great that I literally wanted a second one. In my Second Life I was also a paper salesman and I was also named Dwight. Absolutely everything was the same. Except I could fly. [shot of Dwight's avatar flying around],Dwight,Season 4,4x5
19342,"[reading off piece of paper] Little girl in a field holding a flower, we zoom back to find that she's in the desert and the field is an oasis.

But we zoom back further---",Michael,Season 4,4x5
19344,"Actually I don't get paid by the hour anymore, but thank you, I get paid by the year, so...",Michael,Season 4,4x5
19346,"Yeah, I know.",Michael,Season 4,4x5
19348,"Mmm. Okay. [commercial plays on laptop, peppy music in background]",Michael,Season 4,4x5
19349,That's what Nassau came up with? That sucks! [chuckles] Whoa.,Michael,Season 4,4x5
19351,Well we can do better than that.,Michael,Season 4,4x5
19354,The waving?,Michael,Season 4,4x5

19366,"Okay, calm down. I have a small problem.",Michael,Season 4,4x5
19368,"Yeah, well when I call about big problems you don't like that either, so make up you mind, kiddo. Here is the deal, the ad guys that you sent are locking me in a creative box, and sort of ignoring my ideas.",Michael,Season 4,4x5
19370,"I'm creative, Ryan.",Michael,Season 4,4x5
19372,"Well actually I can't cook, and I am starting a restaurant. Mike's Cereal Shack. I'm thinking we'll have as many varieties as you can buy in the store.",Michael,Season 4,4x5
19374,Yeah!,Michael,Season 4,4x5
19376,"Are you? I don't think you're doing such a good job here, suppressing ideas and creativity.",Michael,Season 4,4x5
19377,"All right, let me ask you this, tell me if you think this is creative. When I was five, I imagined that there was such a thing as a unicorn. And this is before I had even heard of one, or seen one. I just drew a picture of a horse that could fly over rainbows, and had a huge spike in its head. And I was five, five years old. Couldn't even talk yet.",Michael,Season 4,4x5
19378,"Hey guys, um, you know what, we cannot shoot this ad today.",Michael,Season 4,4x5
19380,"How about never hundred hours, sir.",Michael,Season 4,4x5
19383,Hey thanks. Thank you.,Michael,Season 4,4x5
19385,"Yeah, I'm glad you called. Ryan is being a little bitch again.",Michael,Season 4,4x5
19387,"What's up my brotha? Listen, David, I would like to do this ad in house. I want to use only the creativity that we have right here in the office. And I will send it to you tomorrow morning, take a look at it, and if you do not think that it's ready to air, send the ad agency back down here, and we'll do it on my dime.",Michael,Season 4,4x5
19389,I'm willing to stake my entire reputation on it.,Michael,Season 4,4x5
19391,"Okay. [hangs up phone] And thus, Michael Scott sealed his own destiny. In a good way.",Michael,Season 4,4x5
19392,"Has anyone ever come up to you and said, 'You're not creative'?",Michael,Season 4,4x5
19393,Yes.,Dwight,Season 4,4x5
19394,"Well they're wrong. You are creative. You are damn creative. Each and every one of you. You are so much more creative than all of the other dry, boring morons that you work with.",Michael,Season 4,4x5
19395,"Who are you talking to, specifically?",Jim,Season 4,4x5
19399,"We have three scenes to film, big scenes. We have a song to write. So let's get cracking. Kelly, I want you to do makeup. Oscar, I would like you to do costume design, obviously.  Phyllis, I'd like you look around town and see if we have any celebrities in our local area.",Michael,Season 4,4x5
19401,"Okay, okay, Phyllis this is what I want you to do. I want you to go down to the mall. I want you to get in line. I want you to get her to be in this commercial. This would be a huge coupe people. All right? Do not take no for an answer.",Michael,Season 4,4x5
19409,Line it up Phyllis.,Michael,Season 4,4x5
19417,"Time out, time out, time out, time out, time out. I thought... I was under the impression that this was going to be a rap.",Michael,Season 4,4x5
19419,"Okay, Darryl, wow, you need to learn a lot about your own culture. I'll make you a mix.",Michael,Season 4,4x5
19422,Hey.,Jim,Season 4,4x5
19423,"No talk, I'm animating.",Pam,Season 4,4x5
19424,"Why don't we take a quick ten second break from that so I can show you what's going on here. [pulls up Dwight's game] Okay, this is Dwight's Second Life. He's on it all the time. So much so that his little guy here has created his own world. It's called Second Second Life, for those people who want to be removed even further from reality.",Jim,Season 4,4x5
19425,Are you serious?,Pam,Season 4,4x5
19426,Yeah.,Jim,Season 4,4x5
19427,"Oh my God, he's really in pain.",Pam,Season 4,4x5
19428,[sighs],Jim,Season 4,4x5
19429,Who's that?,Pam,Season 4,4x5
19430,"Oh, it's just my avatar guy. Whatever.",Jim,Season 4,4x5
19431,He looks a lot like you. How much time did you spend on that?,Pam,Season 4,4x5
19432,"Not much, it's just for tracking Dwight so---",Jim,Season 4,4x5
19433,Right... you're a sports writer in Philadelphia? Nice build too.,Pam,Season 4,4x5
19434,Yep.,Jim,Season 4,4x5
19435,You have a guitar slung on your back. I did not know you played guitar.,Pam,Season 4,4x5
19436,I... why don't we go back to this animation.,Jim,Season 4,4x5
19437,"No no no, I want to see more of Philly Jim. I want Philly Jim.",Pam,Season 4,4x5
19438,"Ah, show me how this works.",Jim,Season 4,4x5
19439,Oh boy.,Pam,Season 4,4x5
19444,Stop. Stop stop stop stop stop stop. This is not me. This is not my music.,Michael,Season 4,4x5
19447,"No, I hate it! I hate it! ...I don't hate it, I just don't like it at all. And it's terrible.",Michael,Season 4,4x5
19449,"Okay, you know what. Hold on, hold on Darryl.",Michael,Season 4,4x5
19451,"No. I said I hate the, the style.",Michael,Season 4,4x5
19453,"Okay, wow. Wow, this looks uh, terrible.",Michael,Season 4,4x5
19455,"Andy, Andy, this is a pivotal scene in the ad. And if we don't get this, if we don't nail it, we're going to lose the whole triumph of the moment. The triumph of the will. Now, God, what? What Phyllis?",Michael,Season 4,4x5
19457,That'a girl.,Michael,Season 4,4x5
19459,"Did you, or did you not get Sue Grafton?",Michael,Season 4,4x5
19461,"Ugh, can somebody give her a tissue please? [Kevin hands her piece of tape]",Michael,Season 4,4x5
19462,"I hope you're not killing yourself on this, because I'm sure it's good enough for Michael's ad that will probably be seen by no one.",Jim,Season 4,4x5
19463,"Maybe, but it's not good enough for me yet.",Pam,Season 4,4x5
19464,Okay. Do you want me to stay?,Jim,Season 4,4x5
19465,"No no, you can go home. I'm good.",Pam,Season 4,4x5
19466,"Pam is staying late tonight to uh, achieve her dreams. So I'm pretty proud of her, unfortunately she was my ride home.",Jim,Season 4,4x5
19468,"I, ah...",Jim,Season 4,4x5
19470,"Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.",Pam,Season 4,4x5

19473,You're welcome.,Jim,Season 4,4x5
19474,"I worked until about 2:45 AM. And then I had to decide if I wanted to spend the night with Michael editing in his office, and Dwight watching Michael edit in his office, or drive home and probably fall asleep at the wheel and die in a fiery car wreck.

19482,[whispers] Oh D.,Dwight,Season 4,4x5
19485,I'm about to send the ad to corporate... and it is sent. They'll probably watch it right away. I know I would. Okay. [dials phone],Michael,Season 4,4x5
19486,[on phone] Yes?,Pam,Season 4,4x5
19487,"Pam, please clear my phone lines.",Michael,Season 4,4x5

19490,"[Ten days later] Well, it's been tough. The uh, geniuses at corporate rejected my commercial and tonight they are airing the brain dead version. So welcome one and all to the world premiere of Corporate Crapfest!",Michael,Season 4,4x5
19493,"No, it was stupid. People like waving, waving sells. It's not art. Yet we made our ad, the real one was full of humor, and full of depth, and full heart and it was real.",Michael,Season 4,4x5
19494,"Hey, could you do me a favor? Could you put that in the DVD player?",Jim,Season 4,4x5
19495,"Hey everybody! Just want to welcome you all to the premiere of the real Dunder Mifflin commercial, the Michael Scott director's cut. Hope you like it.",Jim,Season 4,4x5

19502,Thanks.,Pam,Season 4,4x5
19504,Ahh. [puts his arm around Pam],Jim,Season 4,4x5
19506,"That was fun. Next round of drinks is on me, people!",Michael,Season 4,4x5
19508,"All right! So, anybody else? No bad ideas. Everybody, let's keep 'em coming... oh, God.  Okay, Toby?",Michael,Season 4,4x5
19510,"There are no bad ideas but for an idea, that was really, really bad.",Michael,Season 4,4x5
19512,"And that is probably why most ads suck. [points to the ad men waiting outside the conference room] Oh, that's them!  Those are the ad guys right there. All right, my very fortunate and creative group, go back to your desks and I will let you know when it is time to film. [everyone starts leaving the conference room] [loud whisper] Pam! Pam, come here for a second. Did you get the memo about dressing your best?",Michael,Season 4,4x5
19513,Yeah.,Pam,Season 4,4x5
19514,About dressing your best today?,Michael,Season 4,4x5

19518,"Okay, good. Good.",Michael,Season 4,4x5
19519,"This is Pam Beesly, representing our girl next door.  Pretty but nothing special.  You know, but she sort of keeps it real. What you might want to do, is if you could zoom in, like really quick zooms on her. Might be good.  [walking away]  Who else? [pointing] Oh, Creed... is the old guy over there. Don't look at him. You might want to use him to sort of get that Orville Redenbacher dynamic going.",Michael,Season 4,4x5
19522,"And if not we can just make him disappear. [walks quickly over to Jim's desk] This is Jim! Halpert. Jim has a very expressive face, don't you Jim? He is like our Mr. Bean.",Michael,Season 4,4x5
19523,Okay.,Jim,Season 4,4x5
19524,"So do, um, do sad, do the sad face.",Michael,Season 4,4x5
19525,I don't want -,Jim,Season 4,4x5
19526,"No, that's skeptical. Do sad.",Michael,Season 4,4x5
19527,Mmm...,Jim,Season 4,4x5
19528,"That's, that's a pirate movie. [Jim stares at Michael] That's annoyed. Well, he doesn't do very well under pressure.",Michael,Season 4,4x5
19530,"And anybody else, we can just hire an actor to replace.  Follow me!  Let's get this movin'. [Dwight goes back to his seat, embarrassed]",Michael,Season 4,4x5
19531,"All right, let's start.",Michael,Season 4,4x5
19532,"All right!  [sitting down behind Michael's desk] I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be doing, but...",Jim,Season 4,4x5

19536,Right.,Jim,Season 4,4x5
19537,...and we need to be done by 9 A.M. tomorrow.,Michael,Season 4,4x5
19538,Mmmhmm.  Why don't you start by telling me what you got.,Jim,Season 4,4x5
19539,We start on a single blank sheet of paper.,Michael,Season 4,4x5
19540,Love it.,Jim,Season 4,4x5
19541,And we widen to reveal ancient Rome.,Michael,Season 4,4x5
19542,"Mm, can't do that.",Jim,Season 4,4x5
19543,"Okay, we widen to reveal a spaceship blasting out of a woman's womb.",Michael,Season 4,4x5
19544,Definitely can't do that.,Jim,Season 4,4x5
19545,Bull[censored] man!,Michael,Season 4,4x5
19546,You know what?,Jim,Season 4,4x5
19547,This is bull[censored]!,Michael,Season 4,4x5
19548,"Okay, Scott, why don't you take your head out of the clouds and come back down to planet Earth so we can make a commercial.",Jim,Season 4,4x5
19549,Ahhhh!  [sweeps toys off his desk],Michael,Season 4,4x5
19550,"I'm just doing my job, man.",Jim,Season 4,4x5

19564,We had already applauded.,Dwight,Season 4,4x5
19565,"Okay, okay.  Who could do music?",Michael,Season 4,4x5
19566,How about Darryl?,Pam,Season 4,4x5
19567,"Actually, I'm a little concerned about having a black person do the music, because that could create a positive stereotype that could then become a... celestine prophesy, and keep the next Bon Jovi from ever picking up a piano.",Michael,Season 4,4x5
19568,"Michael is on a mission to prove that he's creative.  Which I think is odd, because Michael actually might be the most creative person I've ever known.  Every day, Michael says and thinks things that no one has ever said or thought before.",Jim,Season 4,4x5
19576,This is perfect.,Michael,Season 4,4x6
19577,He looks like your twin.,Dwight,Season 4,4x6
19578,"This is a dummy, a la Ferris Bueller's Day Off.  We have tied a string to the wrist, which goes to the door.

19579,I will know.,Dwight,Season 4,4x6
19580,"But, you will not tell anyone.",Michael,Season 4,4x6
19581,I won't need to because we'll be together playing hooky.  Yeah.,Dwight,Season 4,4x6
19582,"Well, sometimes.  Most of the time I will be with Ryan, or Darryl.  [knock on the door]  Yes?  Oh good, good Stanley!  First victim, this is what I want you to do.  Go out, come back in.  We're going to hide.  I want you to tell me if this looks like me, okay?",Michael,Season 4,4x6
19584,"Just go out, and come back in.",Michael,Season 4,4x6
19586,What?,Michael,Season 4,4x6
19587,"Hey everyone, can I have your attention please?  I just thought you all should know that Stanley Hudson is planning on leaving us, because our old friend Karen from Utica is going to give him more money to work there.",Michael,Season 4,4x6
19589,"No, no, no, no, no-no, no no.  You completely misinterpreted my tone, this is a horrible thing.  Clearly, Karen is trying to get back at us because Jim dumped her.",Michael,Season 4,4x6
19590,"Oh, I don't think that is what's happening.",Jim,Season 4,4x6
19591,"Okay, smarty pants, then why?  Why is she trying to take Stanley from us?",Michael,Season 4,4x6
19593,That could not possibly be it.,Michael,Season 4,4x6
19594,"You cannot take the hilarious black guy from the office.  Stanley is part of what makes this branch so extraordinary.  The bluesy wisdom, the sassy remarks, the crossword puzzles, the smile, those big watery red eyes.  I don't know how George Bush did it when Colin Powell left, and if Utica thinks that they are going to poach Stanley, they have another thing coming.",Michael,Season 4,4x6
19595,How can I get you to stay?,Michael,Season 4,4x6
19597,"Yeah we all want money.  But there is none in the budget, so... Tell me why you're really leaving.",Michael,Season 4,4x6
19599,"Mo money mo problems, Stanley.  You of all people should know that.  Let me ask you this, if I were-",Michael,Season 4,4x6

19602,"Oscar, did you bring it?",Pam,Season 4,4x6
19604,"Okay, well I have the tablecloth, don't forget the flatware.",Pam,Season 4,4x6
19606,"Oscar, Toby, and I are founding members of the Finer Things Club.  We meet once a month to discuss books and art, celebrate culture in a very civilized way.  Sometimes the debate can get heated, but we're always respectful.  There is no paper, no plastic, and no work talk allowed.  It's very exclusive.",Pam,Season 4,4x6
19608,So tell me again why I can't be part of your club?,Jim,Season 4,4x6
19609,Because some people think you monopolize the conversation by trying to be funny.,Pam,Season 4,4x6

19621,"Yes, listen, um...  You cannot tear Stanley from his family like this.",Michael,Season 4,4x6

19625,"You can train him.  He's very very smart, and funny, and charming... You know, I can't do it, Toby is the worst.  That- that was a bluff, um...  Listen, if you are going to poach one of my guys, I'm going to poach one of yours.",Michael,Season 4,4x6
19627,"Okay, good-bye.  Wait!  Wait! Karen, could you transfer me to one of your salespeople please?  Your best one?  [Karen hangs up]",Michael,Season 4,4x6

19643,Did they?,Jim,Season 4,4x6
19644,"Yes they did, oh yes they did, and we are going to murder it.  You, me, Dwight are going to jump into my PT Cruiser, and we're going to crush this sale.  We're going to prove, what the hell is that music?",Michael,Season 4,4x6
19645,"It's Vivaldi, for Finer Things.",Pam,Season 4,4x6
19646,"That's the problem, that's the problem.  We need rock n' roll Pam, rock n' roll.  Alright? [sees Toby in a bow-tie holding a plate full of tea cups] Oh... My... God, that's why people are leaving.  I- I have no words.",Michael,Season 4,4x6

19740,"No, no, you won't do that. Nope.",Jim,Season 4,4x6

19841,Yeah.,Jim,Season 4,4x6
19843,"No, that wasn't fun.",Jim,Season 4,4x6
19845,Of course I read it.,Jim,Season 4,4x6
19848,Angela.  Nope.  The ashes.,Jim,Season 4,4x6
19849,[mouths 'I'm sorry' to Oscar],Pam,Season 4,4x6
19854,"Oh, my God.  His letter of recommendation from Rick Santorum is three fifty-dollar bills.",Pam,Season 4,4x6
19862,"Utica is snoozeville, um, Albany are the prepsters, Nashua, no parking, um, Akron is haunted, Camden... is in a basement, Yonkers has the two hot girls, and here in Scranton, we are the cool guys.",Michael,Season 4,4x6
19863,Woo!  Shotgun!,Michael,Season 4,4x6
19864,"Well, you're driving, right?",Jim,Season 4,4x6
19865,"Yes, I am, but I want shotgun for you.",Michael,Season 4,4x6
19866,Mmm... I'd prefer to sit in back.,Jim,Season 4,4x6
19867,Wait!  I wanted to sit next to you.,Dwight,Season 4,4x6
19868,"No, Dwight!  Dwight, Jim is sitting next to me.  You're gonna sit in the back left  where I don't have to see your ugly moongob.",Michael,Season 4,4x6
19869,"Okay, that is so mean!  You know what, I'm not going.",Dwight,Season 4,4x6
19870,"I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Dwight, you're handsome.  You're a very handsome man, get in the car.",Michael,Season 4,4x6
19871,Woohoo!,Dwight,Season 4,4x6
19872,"[on phone] So, there was no sales call.",Pam,Season 4,4x6
19873,"Nnnno.  Uh, turns out, it was just a really bad idea involving fire.  But I think I fixed it.",Jim,Season 4,4x6
19874,"Wait, you're going along with this now?",Pam,Season 4,4x6
19875,"I have to.  Pam, if I'm not there, someone's going to go to jail.  Or die.",Jim,Season 4,4x6
19876,"Right.  And, you wouldn't be able to talk to Karen.",Pam,Season 4,4x6
19877,"Well, I promise you that has nothing to do with it.",Jim,Season 4,4x6
19878,A little bit.,Pam,Season 4,4x6
19879,"Well, yeah I don't want to see her get physically harmed, that's for sure.",Jim,Season 4,4x6
19880,Because you love her?  [baby voice]  Because you love her very much?,Pam,Season 4,4x6
19881,"All right, I'm gonna go now.",Jim,Season 4,4x6
19882,Okay.  Have fun with your girlfriend!,Pam,Season 4,4x6
19883,"Okay, I will. [idiot voice]",Jim,Season 4,4x6
19884,"I'm kidding around.  We joke about that stuff all the time.  I'm not really the jealous type, so, I don't care if Jim sees Karen.  I care a little.",Pam,Season 4,4x6
19886,[moans] Scranton rules! [sprays Silly Spray],Dwight,Season 4,4x6
19887,"Dwight!  Stop it!  [moans]  Can you help me please, I'm being crushed.",Michael,Season 4,4x6
19888,"Would it have killed you to spend the afternoon making love to her in a motel room?  Like I begged you to?  Pam would have understood.  Heck, Pam would have done it.",Michael,Season 4,4x6
19889,Pam is down for anything.,Dwight,Season 4,4x6
19890,You embarrassed me.,Jim,Season 4,4x6
19891,You embarrassed us.,Michael,Season 4,4x6
19892,Yeah.  We shoulda brought Andy.  I cut a chunk out of my penis for nothing.,Dwight,Season 4,4x6
19896,Morning.,Michael,Season 4,4x7
19898,Ryan invited some of the branch managers and Toby into the woods for a 'get to know you' weekend. Michael wasn't invited. Apparently they already knew everything they needed to know about him.,Pam,Season 4,4x7
19899,Did you sleep in cabins?,Pam,Season 4,4x7
19903,Who went?,Pam,Season 4,4x7
19906,"[from outside] Hey, nobody cares. Nobody cares. I need that room at some point, so just, wrap it up.",Michael,Season 4,4x7
19908,"Hypothetically, if I were to ask you to go camping, and you know what hypothetical means? [Jim makes a face] Not real.",Michael,Season 4,4x7
19909,Got it.,Jim,Season 4,4x7
19910,"So if I were to hypothetically ask you to go camping with me, would you go?",Michael,Season 4,4x7
19911,"Absolutely, yes.",Jim,Season 4,4x7
19912,"When Michael plays the hypothetical game, I always say yes.",Jim,Season 4,4x7
19913,Really?,Michael,Season 4,4x7
19914,Yeah?,Jim,Season 4,4x7
19915,"Oh, you wanna go today?",Michael,Season 4,4x7
19916,And I am always busy.,Jim,Season 4,4x7
19917,"Oh, can't go today, 'cause I'm donating blood.",Jim,Season 4,4x7
19918,How often can you actually donate blood?,Michael,Season 4,4x7
19919,Is there a limit?,Jim,Season 4,4x7
19920,Your body only has a certain amount.,Michael,Season 4,4x7
19921,"Well, is that it? Or?",Jim,Season 4,4x7
19922,"Yeah, just this whole Toby, camping thing, uh, seems a little lame.",Michael,Season 4,4x7
19923,How so?,Jim,Season 4,4x7
19924,"A bunch of guys, in a tent? Making s'mores? [makes a noise and gestures with his hands]",Michael,Season 4,4x7
19925,What's that?,Jim,Season 4,4x7
19926,"Hello, I'm Broken Mountain. You know, here's the thing. That's not how you go camping. I think you go camping by yourself---",Michael,Season 4,4x7
19927,Right.,Jim,Season 4,4x7
19928,"In the wilderness. It's not with a group of guys frolicking around in tents. It's one guy, or two guys, if your plans change.",Michael,Season 4,4x7
19929,Not gonna change.,Jim,Season 4,4x7
19930,"I wanna do it myself. You know, I want to go and, and find out something about myself, I wanna get outta here. All the cliques, and the office politics. Fluorescent lights. Asbestos.",Michael,Season 4,4x7
19931,I thought we had that looked at.,Jim,Season 4,4x7
19932,I'm sick of it Jim. I'm sick of this place.,Michael,Season 4,4x7
19933,"When Jan and I had satellite, we used to watch a reality show called 'Survivorman.' And, it was interesting because it was about a guy who would go out in the middle of no where and just try not to die, try not to get eaten by an animal, or be overexposed.",Michael,Season 4,4x7
19934,"OK, I will only need two things. Roll of duct tape and a knife.",Michael,Season 4,4x7
19935,[winks] I'm on it. [leaves room],Dwight,Season 4,4x7
19936,"OK. Thirty minutes or less, please come back. Save the receipts. [Dwight comes back with set of knives] Hey, what...",Michael,Season 4,4x7
19937,Let's see if any of these will work. [clears the front of Michael's desk],Dwight,Season 4,4x7
19938,"Hey, hey hey! Dwight. [Dwight rolls out an assortment knives]. Dwight.",Michael,Season 4,4x7
19939,"I keep various weaponries strategically placed around the office. I saved Jim's life with a can of pepper spray I had velcroed under my desk. People say, 'Oh, it's dangerous to keep weapons in the home or the work place.' Well I say, 'It's better to be hurt by someone you know accidentally, than by a stranger on purpose.'",Dwight,Season 4,4x7
19940,"Dwight and I are going out. He will return later, but I will not. I will also be taking a personal day tomorrow, and perhaps the next day.",Michael,Season 4,4x7
19941,Do you want me to ask where you're going?,Pam,Season 4,4x7
19942,No.,Michael,Season 4,4x7
19943,Great.,Pam,Season 4,4x7
19944,Dwight will be driving me deep into the Pennsylvania wilderness.,Michael,Season 4,4x7
19945,Oh.,Pam,Season 4,4x7
19946,Where he will then leave me to either die or to survive. The choice is yours.,Michael,Season 4,4x7
19947,"Hmm, no, the choice is actually yours. Are you sure you want to do this?",Jim,Season 4,4x7
19948,"Yes, and I am leaving you in charge of the office for the rest of the day and for the next several days. Do not try to follow me.",Michael,Season 4,4x7
19949,"OK, great.",Jim,Season 4,4x7
19950,"This is a very personal, private experience in the wild, that I wish to share it with me, myself and I.",Michael,Season 4,4x7
19951,Yup.,Jim,Season 4,4x7
19952,"When I return, I hope to be a completely changed human being.",Michael,Season 4,4x7
19953,That'd be great.,Jim,Season 4,4x7
19954,"Do I believe that Michael possesses the skills to survive in a hostile environment? Let's put it this way: no, I do not.",Dwight,Season 4,4x7
19955,"This is what a true survivor man does. You simulate a disaster, like a plane wreck. You could only wear the clothes that you have on, and you could only use the stuff you have in your pockets. Now, in this case, this disaster is a serial killer. Creepy guy who's abducted me and is taking me out into the wilderness to leave me for dead.",Michael,Season 4,4x7
19956,"No, I would never leave you for dead. You would never escape.",Dwight,Season 4,4x7
19957,"Well, yes I would. And I would survive.",Michael,Season 4,4x7
19958,I would make sure that you were dead.,Dwight,Season 4,4x7
19959,Well...,Michael,Season 4,4x7
19960,"First, I would remove your teeth and cut off your fingertips so you could not be identified.",Dwight,Season 4,4x7
19961,You...,Michael,Season 4,4x7
19962,And they would call me the Overkill Killer.,Dwight,Season 4,4x7
19963,You... you are as creepy as a real serial killer. For real. [blindfolds eyes with tie] OK.,Michael,Season 4,4x7
19964,What are you doing?,Dwight,Season 4,4x7
19965,"I am putting this on so I have no familiarity with my surroundings. Now this way, I can't retrace my steps. I don't know what streets we've been--- [Dwight whacks Michael with his shoe] Ow! What are you doing?",Michael,Season 4,4x7
19966,It would be better if you were unconscious.,Dwight,Season 4,4x7
19967,"No! Gosh! Dwight. [Dwight tries to hit Michael with his shoe again] Stop it, stop it! Stop it.",Michael,Season 4,4x7
19968,Do you want to do this right or not?,Dwight,Season 4,4x7
19969,"Just, please allow me to have one cathartic experience in my life?",Michael,Season 4,4x7
19971,"Oh, wasn't it just someone's birthday?",Jim,Season 4,4x7
19973,"I do remember, yeah.",Jim,Season 4,4x7
19975,"You know what, I have an idea. Why don't we just do one big shared party?",Jim,Season 4,4x7
19977,"There are thirteen people working in this office, so thirteen times a year Michael gets a cake and balloons, and some sort of joke gift and makes a toast. There are two types of toasts. One is a joke about how old you are.",Jim,Season 4,4x7
19978,[flashback to Stanley's birthday] Look at those wrinkles. Blacks do crack! Not crack the drug.,Michael,Season 4,4x7
19979,"And the other is something inappropriate. Or horrible. Or both. What else? He only sings the high harmony to 'Happy Birthday.' And he's a very big believer in surprise parties. Maybe even, arguably, possibly to a fault.",Jim,Season 4,4x7
19980,"[flashback to Kelly's birthday, hiding in the elevator] Happy Birthday!",Michael,Season 4,4x7
19982,"[flashback to Oscar's birthday, hiding in the break room] Happy Birthday!",Michael,Season 4,4x7
19984,"[flashback to Phyllis' birthday, sneaking up on Phyllis' car] Happy Birthday!",Michael,Season 4,4x7
19986,"So... I think, yeah, I think getting these out of the way might be productive.",Jim,Season 4,4x7
19987,"We can just have one big fun party. Everybody's happy, nobody wastes their time.",Jim,Season 4,4x7
19989,"Wow! You're shaking things up a bit, huh?",Pam,Season 4,4x7
19990,"It's a pretty good idea, don't you think?",Jim,Season 4,4x7
19991,Do you think it's a good idea?,Pam,Season 4,4x7
19992,No... I think it's a great idea.,Jim,Season 4,4x7
19993,[smiles] Hmm.,Pam,Season 4,4x7
19994,We're here. [gets out of the car],Dwight,Season 4,4x7
19995,Dwight will take my blindfold off when we are deep in the forest. Just the two of us from this point out.,Michael,Season 4,4x7
19996,[leading Michael from car] Here we go. Just the two of us [gestures for camera crew to follow],Dwight,Season 4,4x7
19997,"Here we go, into the wild. Mighty forest. Can you smell the trees and the nature?",Dwight,Season 4,4x7
19998,"Keep going, you're fine. Just some bushes and some thickets [leads Michael into some tall grass] Keep going. You wanted wilderness, you got it.",Dwight,Season 4,4x7
19999,"You know, try sending them another invoice.",Jim,Season 4,4x7
20001,"Alright. [starts walking away, but returns] Oh, did you see my memo by the way?",Jim,Season 4,4x7
20003,Right? I was just thinking...,Jim,Season 4,4x7
20005,Right! Exactly. [pats Oscar on the back and walks away] Knew I could count on you. [Oscar rolls his eyes],Jim,Season 4,4x7
20006,Good a spot as any. [They stop and Dwight starts spinning Michael around in circles],Dwight,Season 4,4x7
20007,"What are you doing? Stop. Dwight, Dwight. Just --",Michael,Season 4,4x7
20008,I'm just --,Dwight,Season 4,4x7
20009,Stop.,Michael,Season 4,4x7
20010,Spin. I'm trying to confuse your sense of direction. [stops spinning and takes Michael's blindfold off] Behold.,Dwight,Season 4,4x7
20011,"Alright, good. Thank you, Dwight.",Michael,Season 4,4x7
20012,Here's your knife. Here's your duct tape.,Dwight,Season 4,4x7
20013,"Alright, very good. Ahh, OK. [Dwight gives Michael a hug]",Michael,Season 4,4x7
20014,"Good luck, Michael.",Dwight,Season 4,4x7
20015,"Thanks for the ride. OK. Leave me be, Dwight. [Dwight runs off]",Michael,Season 4,4x7
20017,What's that?,Jim,Season 4,4x7
20019,"Oh, sure.",Jim,Season 4,4x7
20021,OK. [Meredith leaves],Jim,Season 4,4x7
20022,Wow! That was easy.,Pam,Season 4,4x7
20023,"Yeah, people like me I guess.",Jim,Season 4,4x7
20026,Well I think Meredith was just --,Jim,Season 4,4x7
20028,Everybody's birthday.,Jim,Season 4,4x7
20030,What do you want?,Jim,Season 4,4x7
20032,You want a birthday pie?,Jim,Season 4,4x7
20034,"Well, I'm gonna to talk to Angela and we're gonna see what we can do about a pie.",Jim,Season 4,4x7
20036,It will be Angela.,Jim,Season 4,4x7
20038,"[to own camcorder] Day One. I'm in the interior of the vast Pennsylvania wilderness. I've brought with me only the bare essentials. A knife, roll of duct tape, in case I need to craft some shelter or make some sort of water vessel. It's hot today. The sun is in the two-thirds easterly quadrant, which would make it about [looks at watch] 2 o'clock in the afternoon. It's really beating down on me now. I think that I want to get a little more comfortable because the sun is depleting my resources. [cuts pants with knife] OK. OH, there we go. Watch that I don't hit my corroded artery here...",Michael,Season 4,4x7
20039,"I lied to Michael. I said that I would leave him alone, but I will not. I will remain close by to provide unseen moral support, but I will never help him. I will let harm befall him. I will even let him die. But I will never let him lose his dignity.",Dwight,Season 4,4x7
20040,"There we go. [standing with short sleeves and short pants] Much better. Now everything I brought with me can be used. My sport coat here, can be fashioned into a backpack of sorts [ties jacket around neck].",Michael,Season 4,4x7
20041,I'm going to wear what was once one of my pant legs. [puts pant leg on head like a hat],Michael,Season 4,4x7
20042,"See, this is a beautiful piece of material [rips other pant leg in half] This could be used for all sorts of things.",Michael,Season 4,4x7
20043,Some sort of kerchief to keep my neck nice and comfortable.,Michael,Season 4,4x7
20045,Andy.,Jim,Season 4,4x7
20047,Not your birthday.,Jim,Season 4,4x7
20049,"Alright, I'll look into it, but the answer's no.",Jim,Season 4,4x7
20051,"Hey, Andy, I have some calls to make.",Jim,Season 4,4x7
20053,Alright. [Andy rolls back],Jim,Season 4,4x7
20055,"OK, I'm gonna go into this office here [gets up and walks into Michael's office] to do some work. So I will be in here.",Jim,Season 4,4x7
20057,"I am totally alone right now, with only my thoughts. I love it. I'm loving it. I can literally say anything I want. No one is gonna here me. [screams] Wish I could have gone with Ryan on that cool retreat! Jan has plastic boobs! I HAVE HEMORRHOIDS! Doesn't even matter.",Michael,Season 4,4x7
20058,Michael is a man of great depth and passion. I don't know what he's searching for out here. [pulls a nest from a tree] I hope he finds it. [picks up some bird eggs] Lunch.,Dwight,Season 4,4x7
20059,"Well it is a little chillier than I had thought, so I have fashioned my hat back into my pants. Several hours in, time for me to find some nourishment. Now, these woods are full of creatures that can sustain human life. Things like, uh, squirrels, nice juicy rabbit would be delicious.",Michael,Season 4,4x7
20060,About two more minutes [cooking bird eggs].,Dwight,Season 4,4x7
20061,"I have made this spear, with which I will impale my dinner. And it couldn't come a moment too soon because I have been without food for a good three hours or so. I'm startin' to feel it a little bit. Ohh... It's Creed's birthday. [singing] Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to Creed. Happy Birthday to you. Happy birthday, buddy.",Michael,Season 4,4x7
20071,"Hey guys, what're we talking about?",Jim,Season 4,4x7
20073,"Well if you take a look at this, I tented my pants. I've made myself a nice pants tent shelter. And this little guy [pats a large tree trunk] may be Dunder Mifflin paper some day.",Michael,Season 4,4x7
20074,Nothing to worry about. Just using the scope. Safety is... [clicks rifle into safety mode] on.,Dwight,Season 4,4x7
20076,Toby.,Jim,Season 4,4x7
20078,"Oh, thanks man.",Jim,Season 4,4x7
20080,Is there anything --,Jim,Season 4,4x7
20082,"Oh, OK.",Jim,Season 4,4x7
20084,What?,Jim,Season 4,4x7
20086,I remember that.,Jim,Season 4,4x7
20088,Seriously?,Jim,Season 4,4x7
20090,"Toby's great. He's great, but sometimes he can be a little bit much. [in Toby voice] I don't see the harm in that. Well, it's a cake Toby, so, c'mon.",Jim,Season 4,4x7
20091,"OK. Yeah, you know what, we're just gonna throw you in. Because more the merrier, right?",Jim,Season 4,4x7
20094,"That's a bummer. OK, then we need to...[steps outside office] Hey everybody. Hi, how you doing? Can I have your attention please?  'Cause we have to talk about this birthday thing.",Jim,Season 4,4x7
20095,[raises hand] Conference room?,Pam,Season 4,4x7
20096,"Yes, conference room in five minutes... No. No. We're gonna solve it right here. We're actually gonna talk about it out here. So, who has problems with the birthday thing? [everyone raises hands] One, two, three, everybody. OK, so then we just shouldn't do it.",Jim,Season 4,4x7
20101,"Yup, Phyllis called me Michael. And I will always and forever be haunted by that fact.",Jim,Season 4,4x7
20102,"Under this tree, I think I struck the mother load. Those [points camera to mushrooms] are nature's best mushrooms. Wild, and I have to say these little buggers are damn tasty as well. [puts them in mouth]",Michael,Season 4,4x7
20103,"Stop! No, no Michael! Nooo! Nooo! [runs up to Michael and knocks him over] Nooo! Arghh. Get, get them out. [picks out mushrooms from Michael's mouth]",Dwight,Season 4,4x7
20105,"Yeah! [everybody clapping] Alright, skip around the room. Skip around the room. We want -- OK, alright. Yeah, don't do that. You're gonna break something.",Michael,Season 4,4x7
20106,"Man became civilized for a reason. He decided that he liked to have warmth, and clothing, and television, and hamburgers, and to walk upright, and to have a soft futon at the end of the day. He didn't want to have to struggle to survive. I don't need the woods. I have a nice wood desk. I don't need fresh  air, because I have the freshest air around, A.C. And I don't need wide open spaces. Check it out. [shows off computer screen scenery] I can also make it the sky.",Michael,Season 4,4x7
20107,"Hey, buddy.",Michael,Season 4,4x7
20108,Hey.,Jim,Season 4,4x7
20109,What up?,Michael,Season 4,4x7
20110,Sure glad you're back.,Jim,Season 4,4x7
20111,You are relieved.,Michael,Season 4,4x7
20112,You have no idea.,Jim,Season 4,4x7
20113,So what did I miss?,Michael,Season 4,4x7
20114,"Well, I tried to put all the birthdays together at once.",Jim,Season 4,4x7
20115,Oh.,Michael,Season 4,4x7
20116,"So, terrible idea.",Jim,Season 4,4x7
20117,"Yeah, okay, I did that. Rookie mistake.",Michael,Season 4,4x7
20118,You did do it?,Jim,Season 4,4x7
20119,"Uh huh. Yeah, just wait. Ten years, you'll figure it out.",Michael,Season 4,4x7
20120,"Well, I don't think I'll be here in ten years.",Jim,Season 4,4x7
20121,That's what I said. That's what she said.,Michael,Season 4,4x7
20122,That's what who said?,Jim,Season 4,4x7
20123,"I never know. I just say it. I say stuff like that, you know, to lighten the tension. When things sort of get hard.",Michael,Season 4,4x7
20124,That's what she said.,Jim,Season 4,4x7
20125,"Hey! Nice. Really good. Bravo, my young ward.",Michael,Season 4,4x7
20126,Come in!,Michael,Season 4,4x7
20127,"Oh, it's Creed's birthday today.  Should we get him an ice-cream cake?  Mint chocolate chip?",Pam,Season 4,4x7
20128,"Pam, are you my friend?",Michael,Season 4,4x7
20129,"Oh, no.",Pam,Season 4,4x7
20130,"We have been friends forever, right?",Michael,Season 4,4x7
20131,"Yes, I have been working with you forever.",Pam,Season 4,4x7
20132,"Hypothetically... would you go camping with me, if I were to ask you?  And bear in mind that I would never actually ask you to go camping.  That Jim is also a friend of mine, and I would rather die than make any sort of improper ovation toward you.",Michael,Season 4,4x7
20133,I don't think so.,Pam,Season 4,4x7
20134,"Here's the thing.  When Michael invents a hypothetical situation, he eventually turns it into an actual situation.",Pam,Season 4,4x7
20135,"Do you understand that Jim is like a brother to me, and I would never do anything inappropriate?",Michael,Season 4,4x7
20136,I do.,Pam,Season 4,4x7
20137,"So, as friends, would you go with me on a camping trip?",Michael,Season 4,4x7
20138,No.,Pam,Season 4,4x7
20139,Thank you for your honesty.,Michael,Season 4,4x7
20140,You're welcome.  Open or closed?,Pam,Season 4,4x7

20404,"Why did I do it? I don't know. Jan said that it was because of the photo that she revealed the diary. But she already brought the diary with her to New York, so... You expect to get screwed by your company, but you never expect to get screwed by your girlfriend.",Michael,Season 4,4x8

20609,You can buy new stuff but you can't buy a new party.,Pam,Season 4,4x9

20663,Dwight is my friend.,Michael,Season 4,4x9

20667,"Whatever I want? It's never whatever I want. When I wanted to see Stomp, and you wanted to see Wicked, what did we see?",Michael,Season 4,4x9
20669,"When I said that I wanted to have kids, and you said, you wanted me to have a vasectomy, what did I do? And then when you said that you might want to have kids and I wasn't so sure, Who had the vasectomy reversed? And then when you said you defintely didn't want to have kids, who had it reversed back? Snip snap! Snip snap! Snip snap! I did. You have no idea the physical toll, that three vasectomies have on a person. And I bought this condo to fill with children.",Michael,Season 4,4x9
20671,Do you mean it? You want to have a kid? [Jan walks away],Michael,Season 4,4x9

20682,[whispers] Like... like what?,Pam,Season 4,4x9
20683,"I can't prove it but I think she might be trying to poison me. [Jan serves the food] Hey, looks great babe.",Michael,Season 4,4x9
20685,I know Jan didn't poison the food. I know that. But if she was going to poison the food of someone at that table wouldn't it be me? Michael's former lover?,Pam,Season 4,4x9
20687,"You know I have soft teeth, how can you say that?",Michael,Season 4,4x9
20689,Excuse me for a second. [gets up from the table],Michael,Season 4,4x9

20693,Purely carnal and that's all you need to know.,Dwight,Season 4,4x9
20694,Would you write down your e-mail because I have just so many questions...,Jim,Season 4,4x9
20696,Nevermind.,Jim,Season 4,4x9
20697,Ok... alright... here we go. [takes down huge painting behind his seat and puts up a neon beer sign] There. [plugs it in] Oooookay.,Michael,Season 4,4x9
20698,That's nice.,Jim,Season 4,4x9
20699,Everybody enjoying their meal?,Michael,Season 4,4x9
20701,Yeah?,Michael,Season 4,4x9
20703,No. No. I'm gonna leave it up. I think it ties the whole room together.,Michael,Season 4,4x9
20705,[to the guests] Jan thinks Hunter is very talented. You know what? I don't think he's that good.,Michael,Season 4,4x9
20707,BFD. I'm a screenwriter.,Michael,Season 4,4x9

20718,It's getting late.,Jim,Season 4,4x9
20719,"You know what guys, she'll be out of the bathroom soon.",Michael,Season 4,4x9
20720,[Jim and Pam head out the door and there are policemen at the door] Of course,Jim,Season 4,4x9
20721,"Get out of my way, I'll take care of this. OK.[to police] Uhhh what seems to be the problem officers?",Dwight,Season 4,4x9
20723,Nope. Nope. Nothing disturbing here. Just a couple of friends having an awesome dinner party.,Michael,Season 4,4x9
20725,Oh... yes. There was some screaming but... um... my girlfriend... threw a dundie at my TV. Plasma.,Michael,Season 4,4x9
20727,Would she get into trouble?,Michael,Season 4,4x9
20729,I will take the fall. I did it.,Michael,Season 4,4x9
20733,[puts his hand on the Officer's shoulder] Michael can come home with me.,Dwight,Season 4,4x9
20734,Jim? Pam?,Michael,Season 4,4x9
20735,Oh... my apartment's on fire,Jim,Season 4,4x9
20736,[whispers] Flooded.,Pam,Season 4,4x9

20742,Alright. [leads Michael away],Dwight,Season 4,4x9
20744,"[Pam and Jim are sitting in Jim's car in front of Detroit Coney Island Chili Dogs] This is the best burger I've ever had, babe.",Pam,Season 4,4x9
20745,"You know, babe, I should have told you but... I did something bad.",Jim,Season 4,4x9
20746,Hmm?,Pam,Season 4,4x9
20747,[holds up Hunter's CD] I stole this. [Pam laughs] For you babe.,Jim,Season 4,4x9
20748,"[Hunter's voice starts singing, Pam joins in] One night...",Pam,Season 4,4x9
20749,"My ideals at a party? Easy. Jim. Pam. Ryan. The Mayor. Barack Obama. Shiloh Jolie-Pitt. Because at the end of the night, Brad or Angelina would have to come and pick him up and I would get to meet them. Shia La Beef because of Disturbia. Umm, all of the children of the world. Val Kilmer. But he probably wouldn't come, too famous. Obviously George Clooney. Umm... And Jan definitely, if there was room.",Michael,Season 4,4x9
20750,"I'll tell you about my ideal dinner party. John Wilkes Booth. Lee Harvey Oswald. Osama Bin Laden. John Wayne Gacy. Jeffrey Lionel Dahmer. 'Oh hey guys, welcome to my home. Oh, here comes the waiter with the soup, hope you guys are hungry.' Meanwhile, the waiter suddenly nods at me. [Dwight nods] But I don't acknowledge him. But I know he's an assassin because I trained him. Boom. Two minutes later, five dead psychopaths at my dining room table. All that's left to do is dispose of the bodies and collect the reward. Ugh, it's almost too easy.",Dwight,Season 4,4x9
20752,"[to Jim, quietly] Food!",Pam,Season 4,4x9
20761,"Yes, I did, for you, princess.  Even though I only went number one. [quietly to Jim] I didn't really wash my hands.  Ohhh, what have we here?  This looks delicious. [picks up amuse-bouche tray]",Michael,Season 4,4x9
20762,[quietly] Not with your hands.,Pam,Season 4,4x9
20763,[touching and moving each amuse-bouche] They need to be presented... royally... anyone?,Michael,Season 4,4x9
20765,Good stuff.  All right.   Let's get down to some wine drinking.,Michael,Season 4,4x9
20766,"Oh, my God, [eating a bar in the hallway] I thought I was gonna pass out.  [Jim takes it from her and takes a bite]",Pam,Season 4,4x9
20767,We should probably get back.,Jim,Season 4,4x9
20768,"Mmm-mm.  I'm probably just gonna stay here for a while, say I got lost.",Pam,Season 4,4x9
20770,It was just a little...,Pam,Season 4,4x9
20771,"I didn't have anything, Jan.",Jim,Season 4,4x9
20773,"I'm sorry.  She scares me. [walks away, Pam keeps eating]",Jim,Season 4,4x9
20774,"Michael's dinner party is for couples only, which is why I wasn't initially invited.  But that was then.  I very recently entered into a serious, monogamous relationship.  [looking around] If that idiot ever gets here.",Dwight,Season 4,4x9
20776,Where did you grow up?,Pam,Season 4,4x9
20777,It's been a rough couple of weeks.,Michael,Season 4,4x9
20779,"Little trouble.  Yes.  Well, Jan fell asleep during her neighborhood watch shift.",Michael,Season 4,4x9
20780,"Wow, you did neighborhood watch?",Pam,Season 4,4x9
20781,Yes.,Michael,Season 4,4x9
20783,"So she's passed out, and some kids spray-paint a swear word on the neighbors' dog...",Michael,Season 4,4x9
20785,And the neighbors blamed Jan.,Michael,Season 4,4x9
20787,"It's like, you know, the dog shouldn't have been outside in the first place.  Anyway, it's a tragedy, really, because the paint is not gonna come off the dog until it sheds...",Michael,Season 4,4x9
20789,So...,Michael,Season 4,4x9
20791,Well.,Michael,Season 4,4x9
20793,What's that?,Jim,Season 4,4x9
20798,W.B. Jones is renovating their offices and their construction crews are taking up some of the parking spaces we used to get.,Pam,Season 4,4x10
20799,So we had to park at a satellite parking lot over there.,Jim,Season 4,4x10
20800,Which just means we get to see more of our lovely street. Tell them what we saw today Jim.,Pam,Season 4,4x10
20801,"Oh today, we saw a junk yard dog attacking the bones of a rotisserie chicken.",Jim,Season 4,4x10
20802,Nature.,Pam,Season 4,4x10
20806,Some of us like the walk more than others.,Pam,Season 4,4x10
20808,[to Michael who is looking at a chair catalog] Did you pick a new chair? It's been awhile.,Pam,Season 4,4x10
20809,"Pam, when I first opened this catalog, I thought I was just going to be picking out a chair.",Michael,Season 4,4x10
20810,"But instead, you found something to distract you from ever picking out a chair.",Pam,Season 4,4x10
20811,"Michael started the process of selecting a new chair about three weeks ago. And normally I wouldn't care, but he promised me his old one. It's way better. It's one of these. [makes a shrrhhh sound of a chair moving downward as Pam slumps down] I really want it.",Pam,Season 4,4x10
20812,[holding up the catalog] Have you ever seen this woman?,Michael,Season 4,4x10
20813,Her?,Pam,Season 4,4x10
20814,Hmm...,Michael,Season 4,4x10
20815,The one in the really great mesh black high-back swivel chair?,Pam,Season 4,4x10
20816,"Look at her smile. Those eyes, look at her eyes. She's got - I don't know what it is actually, she dresses like a professional and yet you know there is a side of her that could just curl up on a couch.",Michael,Season 4,4x10
20817,Or in a great chair.,Pam,Season 4,4x10
20818,"Oh, yeah, maybe, but remember after my dinner party when I said that I was swearing off women?",Michael,Season 4,4x10
20819,I definitely remember your dinner party.,Pam,Season 4,4x10
20820,I think what I meant was that I was completely swearing off one woman. [whispers] Jan. I think that fate put this catalog in my hands.,Michael,Season 4,4x10
20821,"Actually, I put the catalog in your hands 'cause you have to pick out a new chair.",Pam,Season 4,4x10
20822,What is it like being single? I like it. I like starting each day with a sense of possibility. And I'm optimistic because every day I get a little more desperate and desperate situations yield the quickest results.,Michael,Season 4,4x10
20823,"Ladies and gentleman, would you please open your supply catalogs and kindly turn to page 85. [phone rings]",Michael,Season 4,4x10
20825,"[on phone] No, he hasn't picked one yet.",Pam,Season 4,4x10
20828,"I am ready to start dating again. Getting back on the market. So, FYI, for those of you who are thinking about fixing me up with any of your friends, use the woman on page 85 as a template. That will be all.",Michael,Season 4,4x10
20831,"[to Kevin] Listen man, I am completely over Jan, so, would you set me up?",Michael,Season 4,4x10
20833,I thought that you were engaged?,Michael,Season 4,4x10
20835,"Whaaaat? God, that's terrible man. Eghh, she's crazy. Umm, are you still on good terms with any of her friends?",Michael,Season 4,4x10
20837,Oh...,Michael,Season 4,4x10
20839,Yeah... ugh. She's... [gets up and leaves] you don't deserve her. Alright.,Michael,Season 4,4x10
20840,"[sitting on Oscar's desk] Oh hello Oscar Mayer Weiner lover. I bet that you have a bunch of very liberal girl type friends that trust you implicitly because they know you'd never touch 'em, because of your condition. Umm...",Michael,Season 4,4x10
20842,What?,Michael,Season 4,4x10
20844,Oh.,Michael,Season 4,4x10
20846,"Hmm, I see, feisty. So she's not jolly or sassy? Not like a jolly, sassy opera singer?",Michael,Season 4,4x10
20848,Oooo. Catcher or in field?,Michael,Season 4,4x10
20850,"Is she a dress wearer or a pants wearer? Could we share a row boat? Could, could a row boat support her?",Michael,Season 4,4x10
20852,I think I'm being very clear what I'm asking. Would an average size row boat support her without capsizing? [silence] It bothers me that you're not answering the question.,Michael,Season 4,4x10
20854,"Damn it, I knew it! I knew it Phyllis! OK!",Michael,Season 4,4x10
20855,What is wrong with these people? I would do anything for them and they're just hanging me out to dry.,Michael,Season 4,4x10
20856,"Dating shouldn't be hard for somebody like me, but it is and you know why? Because nobody here is willing to help me. Nothing would ever get done in this office without a formal request, would it? Well, fine. Here goes.",Michael,Season 4,4x10
20858,"Well, now OK, I know that this is probably not appropriate, but I need help. Because I want to play ball with my kids before I get too old. And before that happens I need to get laid. And before that happens I need to be in love. And I don't wanna hear 'Ahnnn... I can't help elhh la la.' No. No. I'm a catch and I am not going to be the one who got away. So, this is what we're going to do. Dwight is going to hand out index cards and I want you all to write down the name of an eligible woman for me to date by the end of the day. No, by the end of the hour or you are fired.",Michael,Season 4,4x10
20859,[gets up from chair] Write legibly people.,Dwight,Season 4,4x10
20861,Hmm..,Michael,Season 4,4x10
20864,"Well, look, I am in an assigned parking place in front, so... Alright, alright, alright, umm let me try to think about what it would be like to not have one. [thinks] OK, yes that would be bad.",Michael,Season 4,4x10
20867,That would be bad.,Michael,Season 4,4x10
20871,"Wish I could, but I can't. Well can, but won't. Should, maybe, but shorn't.",Michael,Season 4,4x10
20873,"What part of shorn't don't you understand, Kevin? Look I could probably handle it, yes, but I think it would be a good exercise for you guys to do it yourselves.",Michael,Season 4,4x10
20875,"Oh you can't because I don't care. Listen, [Kevin and Andy high five as they leave Michael's office] don't forget to fill out those cards. My love cards.",Michael,Season 4,4x10
20878,[to Jim] Who are you putting down?,Pam,Season 4,4x10
20879,"Oh, you don't know her.",Jim,Season 4,4x10
20880,Who is it?,Pam,Season 4,4x10

20889,"[under breath] Damn it Kevin. OK, umm, could I just have a frosty and a baked potato please?",Michael,Season 4,4x10
20891,"Well, I'll send somebody to come pick it up. Just have it ready.",Michael,Season 4,4x10
20893,Well put it aside. [hangs up the phone] [Dwight enters] Umm... yeah.,Michael,Season 4,4x10
20894,"OK, I have collected the rest of the ladies.",Dwight,Season 4,4x10
20895,Good. Good because this batch was awful. Umm... this one says chair model...,Michael,Season 4,4x10
20896,"I wrote that. Michael, you shouldn't have to settle. This is my pledge to you. I will find her and I will bring her to you and as God as my witness, she shall bear your fruit.",Dwight,Season 4,4x10
20897,"That sounds good. [both smile] Go get her. Wa-Wait, wait, wait, wait. First, go to Wendy's, get my food. Come back and then go.",Michael,Season 4,4x10

20899,"The furniture company gave me the name of the advertising agency. They gave me the name of the photographer. The photographer, a Spaniard, used a Wilkes-Barre modeling agency.

20900,She's dead? [Dwight makes knife slitting noise] She's so young.,Michael,Season 4,4x10
20901,She was so young and now she is dead. As dead as every dead animal who has ever died.,Dwight,Season 4,4x10
20902,"Oh, God. Oh...",Michael,Season 4,4x10
20903,Why don't you sit down? Michael... come on. [gets up and leads Michael to sit in his chair] Here we go. Yeah.,Dwight,Season 4,4x10
20904,"Michael, you didn't even know her.",Jim,Season 4,4x10
20905,Try not to be so hurtful Jim.,Michael,Season 4,4x10
20906,"Jim, how dare you. [Jim's face is in shock]",Dwight,Season 4,4x10
20907,"Please, not at a time like this. [sighs]",Michael,Season 4,4x10
20908,"OK Michael, you know what? I might have someone for you.",Pam,Season 4,4x10
20909,Oh really? What's her name? Burger King?,Michael,Season 4,4x10

20992,Nice. [fist bumps Kevin],Jim,Season 4,4x10
20995,[looking at the chair model's headstone] How did she die?,Michael,Season 4,4x10
20996,I guess you could say she died of blunt force trauma and blood loss. She got in a car accident and plowed into the side of an airplane hanger.,Dwight,Season 4,4x10
20997,God.,Michael,Season 4,4x10
20998,Yeah.,Dwight,Season 4,4x10

21000,She was stoned apparently.,Dwight,Season 4,4x10
21001,"You know I used to think that I had this perfect person out there waiting for me, but knowing that, that's just silly because she's dead. What do you do?",Michael,Season 4,4x10

21012,How could I have thought that? How could I have thought that?,Pam,Season 4,4x10
21013,"[singing] Bye, bye, Ms. Chair Model lady. I dreamt that we were married and you treated me nice. We had lots of kids...drinking whiskey and rye, oh why'd you have to go off and die? Why'd you have to go off [with Dwight] and die?",Michael,Season 4,4x10

I have spent the last month here at Dwight's lovely farm, taking a little bit of a vacation, clearing my head after Jan and I, um [Dwight puts his fingers to his head and makes a shooting noise] ssp... No, I did not kill her.  We were just at different places in our lives.  No, I thought I'd be the bigger man and allow her to stay at the condo.  She has since moved on; she is staying with her sister in Scottsdale.  Fresh outlook, and it's all good.",Michael,Season 4,4x10
21019,"Okay, so look that over, make sure it's accurate.",Dwight,Season 4,4x10

21021,"Your bill, minus the ten percent Dunder Mifflin corporate discount.",Dwight,Season 4,4x10
21022,You were charging me?  I'm your friend.,Michael,Season 4,4x10

21024,There was no other guest the entire time I was here.,Michael,Season 4,4x10
21025,Right.  Because you were in the America room.  In an election year.,Dwight,Season 4,4x10
21026,"Okay.  All right, Dwight.  Take my money.  Go ahead.  Keep in mind that this whole thing was just a business transaction.  The late nights, the talks, the slumber parties, the crying jags, that was all business, that had nothing to do with friendship, and being friends.  Just ring me up.  Go ahead [Dwight tears up bill].",Michael,Season 4,4x10

21036,"Love.  Marriage.  Baby carriage.  Those have been my goals ever since I heard that song.  Jan and I had love.  We did not have marriage.  We did have a baby carriage, which I got her for bringing groceries home, after she got a DUI.",Michael,Season 4,4x10
21038,"[sitting at her desk] Hey, Kelly.",Michael,Season 4,4x10
21040,Nothing.  Just hangin'.  Chillin'.  No agenda.  Would you consider hookin' me up with one of your friends?,Michael,Season 4,4x10

21095,[sighs],Michael,Season 4,4x11
21096,"I will be honest; the dating has not been going well. Look, men are visual creatures.

Not that they aren't nice, or that have great personalities, they just... They just lack a certain... Crawfordness.",Michael,Season 4,4x11

21129,And then an older gentleman asked you 'Boxers or briefs?',Jim,Season 4,4x11
21134,"[slow clapping] Ryan has done a very good job, and I am not applauding sarcastically.

21376,"Shh, just stop. Here's what you do. You tell him that you're his friend and that you're gonna help him and that everyone's gonna be all right. And then you put a wire on him and you find out who's selling him drugs and then you get that guy and you flip up, turn him into a snitch. You follow that guy to the people who's really really bad.

21500,"Everybody, so how are we going to energize our office? I mean, I haven't done anything since Christmas. Pam, clearly, has just given up trying.

21502,"Zing and pep, see that's those are the kind of words we're looking for. Yes, Jim?",Michael,Season 4,4x12
21503,What about if we did an even newer voicemail message that had even more zing and pep?,Jim,Season 4,4x12
21504,"Now we're cooking. I like this. Maybe a whole theme, like a rap. A rap rhyme...",Michael,Season 4,4x12
21505,An urban thing...,Jim,Season 4,4x12
21506,"An urban, yeah, Stanley? You wanna help us out with that?... Stanley, earth to Stanley...",Michael,Season 4,4x12

21524,"Well you don't get it, because Stanley is a beautiful, sassy, powerful black man, and you're... you. If you had any friends, you would understand. Friends joke with one another: 'Hey um, you're poor.' 'Well hey, you're mama's dead.' That's what friends do. It's... you're so white.",Michael,Season 4,4x12
21526,Mmhmm.,Michael,Season 4,4x12

21534,"Uh, bumper's sagging.",Dwight,Season 4,4x12
21536,This car's crap. I will buy it for next to nothing.,Dwight,Season 4,4x12
21538,"Well, here are your options: you can sell it for parts, drive it off a cliff... you can donate it to a person that you'd like to see die in a car crash, or, you can sell it to me, and I'll use it as I would a wagon on my farm. It will be towed by a donkey.",Dwight,Season 4,4x12
21540,Yes.,Dwight,Season 4,4x12
21542,"You know what? You knock $1500 of the price right now, and I will take it off your hands. It's gotta be now.",Dwight,Season 4,4x12

21559,"Well, you know, uh, the thing that you said earlier, that you didn't mean, um, and that I forgive you for. The whole thing's silly, isn't it? Friends don't need to apologize to friends as far as I'm concerned, so we are cool.",Michael,Season 4,4x12
21562,"Jim is in charge of Stanley only in sales-related matters, hence the green line--green for money-sales, get it?",Dwight,Season 4,4x12
21563,Uh huh...,Michael,Season 4,4x12
21564,There is this yellow zigzag that does give Ryan the authority to discipline Stanley...,Dwight,Season 4,4x12
21565,Great,Michael,Season 4,4x12
21566,"However, in so doing, it zigs past your name, hence zagging you and making you appear weak. Thus the yellow color. Yellow for cowardly.",Dwight,Season 4,4x12
21567,What's the pink?,Michael,Season 4,4x12
21568,Menstrual cycles.,Dwight,Season 4,4x12

21570,You.,Dwight,Season 4,4x12
21571,Other than me.,Michael,Season 4,4x12
21572,"Well, there is the emergency disaster mode for the org chart. This gives me full authority over every single person in the office.",Dwight,Season 4,4x12
21573,I never said you could do that.,Michael,Season 4,4x12
21574,All you have to do it say it.,Dwight,Season 4,4x12
21575,I...,Michael,Season 4,4x12
21576,Just say it.,Dwight,Season 4,4x12
21577,"Okay, I will think about it.",Michael,Season 4,4x12
21578,"Say it. Just do it. Don't think, say it. Do it. Five, four, three, two... do it. Give me control. Michael... I promise to give authority back to you when this crisis is over. Do it, Michael. Do it. Hey, this office needs a strong man. Say it.",Dwight,Season 4,4x12
21579,No.,Michael,Season 4,4x12

21601,"I knew it. Okay, who we talking about here? Crips? Bloods?",Michael,Season 4,4x12
21603,God.,Michael,Season 4,4x12

21607,"Okay, so dig this: you're on the street, and one of your gang disses you.",Michael,Season 4,4x12
21609,"Yeah, right, so what do you do to get them to make it right?",Michael,Season 4,4x12
21611,What is that?,Michael,Season 4,4x12
21613,Really?,Michael,Season 4,4x12
21615,I would've never thought that gangs would be tickling each other.,Michael,Season 4,4x12

21626,"I'm sorry, then do you mind explaining a little better? Cause I'm not sure what's really...",Jim,Season 4,4x12
21629,"Hey, what happened? What did Ryan want?",Pam,Season 4,4x12
21630,"Oh we were just... talking about, bureaucratic stuff...",Jim,Season 4,4x12

21638,"I've got a Madlib for you: a stupid, idiotic, numbskull named Andy Bernard sold his Xterra to a smart and capable man named Dwight. This is shaping up to be an awesome day for Dwight.",Dwight,Season 4,4x12

21640,What does that mean?,Pam,Season 4,4x12
21641,It's like a mock execution.,Michael,Season 4,4x12
21642,That's not a good idea.,Jim,Season 4,4x12
21643,Yes it is a good idea. It's the only possible solution I have left.,Michael,Season 4,4x12
21645,"No, okay... I've had enough of you.",Michael,Season 4,4x12
21647,"Because I want you to behave as if I'm actually firing him, Oscar, okay?",Michael,Season 4,4x12
21649,"I'm not firing him. I'm not, I need you to act like I am firing him. Just, what I'm going to do, is I'm going to pretend that I am firing him, and I need you to act like I am firing him. Do you get that? Do you get it? I'm teaching him a lesson. He needs to learn humility, alright? That's all I'm, okay, here he comes. Let's just... play act.

22034,Okay.,Michael,Season 4,4x14

22077,I hate her too.,Dwight,Season 4,4x14

22110,Y-You can-Michael.,Michael,Season 4,4x14
22111,"Thanks to Toby, I have a very strong prejudice against Human Resources. I believe that the department is a breeding ground for monsters.

22201,"I know. Here, Michael, you can court her as you get to know her, you know? I mean, the office is a great place for that. Pam and I, we got to know each other right out there. I mean, the first time we joked around was at my desk. And the first meal we ever had was, in the break room, actually. We were at two separate tables and, I remember that. The first time we kissed even, was right outside, and... Look, all I'm saying is that you can get to know someone really really well, like I did, right here at work.",Jim,Season 4,4x14

24619,I agree.,Michael,Season 5,5x6
24620,Yeah.,Jim,Season 5,5x6

[taps Bluetooth earpiece] Pam, sorry about that. I lost you for a second. So, as it turns out, I may not have done so hot on my customer reviews this year.",Jim,Season 5,5x6

24789,No. Why? No. [puts it in desk drawer and slams it shut],Dwight,Season 5,5x6
24790,"OK, I'm gonna assume that was it. Here's the thing: I think you're right. I think it was Kelly. I think she's mad at us for not coming to her party.",Jim,Season 5,5x6
24791,"Oh, man, I knew it. Who are her co-conspirators?",Dwight,Season 5,5x6

24872,"How did I propose, let me see... well, I drove her up to Nashua, and I had the ring, a big 10-carat diamond; it was beautiful. And I got down on my hands and knees, and a shooting star crossed overhead, and it just lit up the diamond like a shooting star. And we were in a restaurant, and I put the diamond into a cheeseburger.",Michael,Season 5,5x6

24884,Tell him you'd like to go with him.,Pam,Season 5,5x6
24885,We should take a look at those surveys.,Jim,Season 5,5x6
24886,"Why are surveys important? Okay, hypothetical: A man wants to buy 500 reams of....carrots. And, so he's like 'What do I do? Where do I go? Do I go to the insensitive carrot supplier, the insensitive carrot salesman? Or do I go to the nice carrot salesman, who will maybe charge a few cents more per ream of carrot, but guarantee next-day delivery on your carrots? Most companies need their carrots the next day. Now, substitute paper for carrots, and that is why surveys are important.'",Michael,Season 5,5x6
24887,"Great marks, Phyllis. [Phyllis walks out of Michael's office smiling]",Michael,Season 5,5x6
24891,"What do I do with my bonus check? [scoffs] Simple. Purchase paper from myself. Boosts my sales, which boosts my bonus. Last year I bought even more paper to make this year's bonus even bigger. Eventually, I'll get a bonus so big I can retire on it. And I'll use the paper to write my memoirs.",Dwight,Season 5,5x6
24892,"I taught Jim and Dwight everything I know about sales. But there are certain things that cannot be taught, and it is these things that I now must teach them.",Michael,Season 5,5x6

24897,"Dwight and I are both writing letters to our clients. I'm just sending a quick note to say how much I appreciate their business, and he is writing notarized letters to inform them them that lying on customer reviews is a prosecutable form of fraud and defamation. It's just... different styles.",Jim,Season 5,5x6
24898,"My job is to manipulate the customer into buying paper. In return, they give me money. I am the predator and they are the prey. Would a mouse give a positive review to a hawk? Should the hawk even care? [sighs heavily, nearly starts to cry] Excuse me, I've got work to do.",Dwight,Season 5,5x6
24901,"Hey, what are you laughing at?",Dwight,Season 5,5x6
24903,Are you laughing at me?,Dwight,Season 5,5x6
24906,[looks at cartoon] How is that funny? What are you really laughing at? Huh?,Dwight,Season 5,5x6
24909,[looking at cartoon] There's no way you're laughing at this.,Dwight,Season 5,5x6

[pretends to kiss, then shoot imaginary person to his left]  Then I shoot myself, so I don't change history and create a paradox. BOOM! But right at the last minute, [contorts head sideways] I twist out of the way of the bullet. Nice try, history. Better luck next year.",Dwight,Season 5,5x6

I mean you can't blame my parents it was the 70's.  And why would you want to buy ugly wood from trees when you can have paneling?

I tell her to meet me in Mexico but I go to Canada.  I don't trust her.  Besides, I like the cold.  Thirty years later, I get a postcard.  I have a son and he's the chief of police.  This is where the story gets interesting: I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris, by the Trocadero.  She's been waiting for me all these years; she's never taken another lover.  I don't care, I don't show up. I go to Berlin.  That's where I stashed the chandelier.",Dwight,Season 5,5x8

25767,"Oh, okay. Good. Good. Well, here's the thing. Some people want to use the surplus to buy a new copier. Other people are complaining about the chairs.",Michael,Season 5,5x9
25769,"It is, yes.",Michael,Season 5,5x9
25771,What?,Michael,Season 5,5x9
25773,Okay.,Michael,Season 5,5x9
25774,You can try mine.,Pam,Season 5,5x9
25775,"Oh, there we go.",Michael,Season 5,5x9
25777,"Now everyone, bear in mind once again that whatever Hank says goes. He is an impartial third party.",Michael,Season 5,5x9
25779,"So, the copier.",Michael,Season 5,5x9
25781,"All right, yes.",Michael,Season 5,5x9
25783,"Well, what should I do?",Michael,Season 5,5x9
25785,"All right, get out. Get out.",Michael,Season 5,5x9
25787,I know you did. And that's why I have taken care of everything.,Dwight,Season 5,5x9
25789,"Well Monkey, he's a real minister. And you said, 'I do.' And I said, 'I do.' And Andy wasn't signing a receipt; he was signing our marriage certificate as a witness.",Dwight,Season 5,5x9
25791,"Yes, of course it does.",Dwight,Season 5,5x9
25793,It does in the state of Pennsylvania.,Dwight,Season 5,5x9
25795,"Haha, Mrs. Schrute.",Dwight,Season 5,5x9
25797,Wha...,Dwight,Season 5,5x9
25799,My... It's not my fault you don't understand German; I've been telling you to take it for years!,Dwight,Season 5,5x9
25802,Hey David- [begins coughing violently] I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm eating tiramisu. Some of the chocolate powder just went down my throat. I'm stopping now.,Michael,Season 5,5x9
25804,"No, no, no, no, no. No. I'm calling- [coughs again] I'm sorry.",Michael,Season 5,5x9
25806,"Mm. I'm calling because, um, we have a stupid budget surplus, and people-everybody wants something different.",Michael,Season 5,5x9
25808,"No, no, no. I want you to make the decision so I'm not the bad guy.",Michael,Season 5,5x9
25810,The what now?,Michael,Season 5,5x9
25812,...Like a tip? [calculates amount] $645?!,Michael,Season 5,5x9
25813,"I hate disappointing just one person. And I really hate disappointing everyone. But I love Burlington Coat Factory. You go in there with $645, you are literally a king.",Michael,Season 5,5x9
25814,"[on the phone] We have that going out Tuesday... Okay? Sure, no, I can... I'll double-check that for you.",Jim,Season 5,5x9
25815,"All right, attention everyone.",Michael,Season 5,5x9
25816,Let me call you right back. Okay.,Jim,Season 5,5x9
25817,"I have made my decision. We do not need a new copier. We do not need new chairs. This copier... is... [puts paper on glass and makes a copy, then takes paper from glass] working perfectly.",Michael,Season 5,5x9
25819,"Pam, would you stand up for a sec? [sits in Pam's chair] Hmm. See how relaxed I am? I like this chair. [slowly sinking into the chair] Offers good support, it is urkelnomically correct... it's a good chair. I think we're spoiled because we don't appreciate the things that we have. You think kids in Africa have chairs? No. They sit in big piles of garbage. You think they have copiers?  [the chair has slowly lowered itself almost to where Michael is not visible over the desk] They don't have copiers. They don't even- [struggles to get up from Pam's chair] Gah! They don't even have paper. And we are spoiled because we throw out perfectly good tiramisu because it has a little tiny hair on it. My point I this: I have seen the light in terms of what we need, and it is nothing.",Michael,Season 5,5x9
25821,Do I know what?,Michael,Season 5,5x9
25823,"Mm, no...",Michael,Season 5,5x9
25825,"Yeah, know what?",Pam,Season 5,5x9
25827,$645.00,Michael,Season 5,5x9
25829,Right.,Michael,Season 5,5x9
25831,Because that is how my mind works.,Michael,Season 5,5x9
25833,"Wait, what?",Jim,Season 5,5x9
25834,You can do that?,Pam,Season 5,5x9
25836,Let's see...,Michael,Season 5,5x9
25837,You're gonna give yourself a bonus of $645 instead of getting the entire office something it really needs?,Pam,Season 5,5x9
25838,"I don't need $645; I already have $645, more or less.",Michael,Season 5,5x9
25840,This is so stupid.,Michael,Season 5,5x9
25841,Or chairs?,Pam,Season 5,5x9
25842,"This is so, so stupid. And, God... [looks at his watch] that's my phone.",Michael,Season 5,5x9
25844,To be continued!,Michael,Season 5,5x9
25845,"No, I don't-this doesn't change anything. I have a very important decision to make. We need a new copier. We need new chairs. And I need to figure out a way to keep this money without having everybody hate me.",Michael,Season 5,5x9
25849,So what's it gonna be?,Pam,Season 5,5x9
25851,"Let me just say, you've been promising me this chair since the day you hired me.",Pam,Season 5,5x9
25853,[groans in frustration] You think it's easy?,Michael,Season 5,5x9
25855,"Okay, you know what? Why don't you guys deal with it? I am going to get up, and I am going to be out in the common area. But you need to decide; otherwise I'm taking the bonus. All right?",Michael,Season 5,5x9
25856,"It is a classic management tactic. You have two sides, a deadline, you know that neither of them are gonna concede. What you do is you put 'em in a room, and you just- [Pam and Oscar come to the door of kitchen] Hey.",Michael,Season 5,5x9
25857,Hey.,Pam,Season 5,5x9
25859,What?,Michael,Season 5,5x9
25861,Thanks Michael.,Pam,Season 5,5x9
25862,Good work. I'm proud of you. [Pam and Oscar leave] Mother-,Michael,Season 5,5x9
25863,"[wearing a fur coat] What did we learn this week? Well, one, thanks to me, my team is much, much faster at coming to decisions than I thought they would be. Number two, never buy a fur coat with a credit card until you absolutely have the money to pay for it. And three, [camera zooms out to see fake blood is splattered on the fur coat] you should know that some people think it's cool to throw buckets of fake blood on you as you are walking out of Burlington Coat Factory.",Michael,Season 5,5x9
25864,Truce?,Jim,Season 5,5x9
25865,"Yeah, I guess, since I won.",Pam,Season 5,5x9
25866,"Yeah, you did win. You did win. Anyway, I'm going to need three copies of each of these, stapled and collated. [begins to walk away, then turns back] Totally kidding. [leans in, whispers] I'm gonna need four. [kisses Pam]",Jim,Season 5,5x9
25867,What is this?,Dwight,Season 5,5x10
25868,"Happy Holidays, Dwight. But do not open it till Christmas.",Jim,Season 5,5x10
25869,You're so pathetic.  How long did this take you? Three hours?,Dwight,Season 5,5x10
25870,Five minutes actually.  I am a black belt in gift wrapping.,Jim,Season 5,5x10
25871,"Yeah, no such thing.  They don't give out black belts for things that are stupid. [scoffs]  Well, I hope it was worth it, cause I'm gonna take it apart in about five minutes.",Dwight,Season 5,5x10
25872,I think it'll take you a little longer than that.,Jim,Season 5,5x10
25873,"Really? If I can skin a mule deer in less than ten minutes, I ought to be able to cut my -- [sets briefcase on desk and sits in chair, desk and chair are made of paper, Dwight crashes to the floor]",Dwight,Season 5,5x10
25878,"Hey, Phyllis, do I need this invite to get in to the party?",Michael,Season 5,5x10
25880,Awesome.  I think this is going to be the best Christmas party ever.,Michael,Season 5,5x10
25889,Ah. You brought in your doll collection.,Jim,Season 5,5x10
25890,"These are not dolls, Jim.  These are commodities.  Same as gold or oil.",Dwight,Season 5,5x10
25891,"Every year I do research to determine which toy will be the most popular of the Christmas season.  This year it's a doll. Half girl, half unicorn.  Catchphrase: 'My horn can pierce the sky'.  Pathetic. I bought out every store in the area over the last couple of weeks.  And as lazy parents become desperate I will sell them for an enormous profit.  Isn't that right princess? [makes doll nod]",Dwight,Season 5,5x10
25892,That's the Christmas spirit.,Jim,Season 5,5x10
25893,I am simply punishing those parents that would wait till the last minute to get their child a gift.  And such a genetically improbable one.  Look at that.  How does that happen?  King has sex with a unicorn?  Man with a horn has sex with a royal horse?,Dwight,Season 5,5x10
25894,Yes.,Jim,Season 5,5x10
25895,"Oh, hey, is that Princess Unicorn?  I thought they were all sold out.",Michael,Season 5,5x10
25896,They are now.,Dwight,Season 5,5x10
25897,Cool. [sings] My horn can pierce the sky.,Michael,Season 5,5x10
25898,"This is equal parts scotch, absinthe, rum, gin, vermouth, triple sec, and two packs of Splenda. Call it a one of everything.",Michael,Season 5,5x10
25900,Alright... One more time around the block.,Michael,Season 5,5x10
25901,I will grant you one wish.,Jim,Season 5,5x10
25902,I wish that you'd stop rubbing that lamp in that creepy way.,Pam,Season 5,5x10
25903,Stupid.  Everyone knows to ask for a hundred more wishes. [Pam laughs] Dumb.,Jim,Season 5,5x10
25907,"Jim, Jim....",Michael,Season 5,5x10
25908,What is it?,Jim,Season 5,5x10
25909,That is vodka and I mixed it with orange juice.  I call it an orange-vod-juice...ka.,Michael,Season 5,5x10
25910,"Wow, that is delicious.",Jim,Season 5,5x10
25911,Yeah.,Michael,Season 5,5x10
25912,Can't believe no ones thought of that.,Jim,Season 5,5x10
25913,I know.,Michael,Season 5,5x10
25917,All right.,Dwight,Season 5,5x10
25919,"Oh, so glad I could help.",Dwight,Season 5,5x10
25921,Merry Christmas.,Dwight,Season 5,5x10

25925,"[Meredith's hair is on fire] Oh, oh, oh, oh!",Jim,Season 5,5x10
25926,We got a live one!  On fire!! [Dwight extinguishes Meredith],Dwight,Season 5,5x10
25930,"Can not do it then. Monthly dental appointment, soft teeth",Michael,Season 5,5x10
25932,Ah... would you want to do it on Groundhogs day?,Jim,Season 5,5x10
25933,"No, no. I celebrate privately.",Michael,Season 5,5x10
25934,That's cool.,Jim,Season 5,5x10
25935,Why don't we just do it now? We'll do it quickly.,Michael,Season 5,5x10
25937,We'll do it quickly.,Michael,Season 5,5x10
25938,Well what if we can't do it quickly.,Jim,Season 5,5x10
25939,[mimicking] What if we can't do it quickly? What if we cant do it--,Michael,Season 5,5x10
25941,"Hey, shut up. Here we go. Everybody gather up.",Michael,Season 5,5x10
25942,"An intervention.  It's sort of hard to describe, but really its-- it's a coming together... it's a surprise party for people who are-- who have addictions.  And you get in their face and you scream at them and you make them feel really badly about themselves.  And then they stop.",Michael,Season 5,5x10
25946,"Okay, how do you feel?",Michael,Season 5,5x10
25948,Uck... T.M.I.,Michael,Season 5,5x10
25950,Yeah.,Jim,Season 5,5x10
25951,"Okay, you know what I thought we should do is have a quick intervention and then get back to the party.",Michael,Season 5,5x10
25953,I am not asking her to stop drinking.  I am imploring her to quit being an alcoholic.,Michael,Season 5,5x10
25955,"Yeah, obviously you are. Okay, everybody who thinks that Meredith is an alcoholic please raise your hand. [everyone raises their hand]",Michael,Season 5,5x10
25956,Aye.,Dwight,Season 5,5x10
25957,The aye's have it.,Michael,Season 5,5x10
25959,"Alright, well, let's look at this a little bit closer then shall we? [pulls a piece of paper out of his pocket]",Michael,Season 5,5x10
25961,"Meredith, have you ever used alcohol to alter your mood or deliberately change your state of mind?",Michael,Season 5,5x10
25963,Do you sometimes have a drink to celebrate a special occasion or mark a holiday?,Michael,Season 5,5x10
25965,Have you ever under the influence of alcohol questioned the teachings of the Mormon church?,Michael,Season 5,5x10
25967,"I got it on a website, that's not important.",Michael,Season 5,5x10
25969,"Okay, you know what Toby?  One of my employees is undergoing a crisis and I wish for just once you would take my side on this.  I'm doing your job man.  Hey, are you texting?",Michael,Season 5,5x10
25971,"Alcohol is a drag. Yes.  Here's what I'd like to do.  I'd like to go around the room and have us each express to Meredith how her alcoholism has affected us.  I'll begin.  This Christmas party is perhaps the best Christmas party I have ever been to, but then you got so drunk that we had to stop and do this.  That's how your drinking affected me.  Anybody else?  Another time when Meredith's drinking affected you?   Come on people.  If we don't say anything she's not going to get any better.  [Kevin raises his hand] Yes, Kevin.",Michael,Season 5,5x10
25973,That's-- you didn't-- you weren't hurt by that.,Michael,Season 5,5x10
25976,"Okay, no, that's not what we're going for.  Who has a problem with Meredith's drinking?  It has to bother you.  It bothers me. Right? How does it bother you?  Dwight, don't you have anything?",Michael,Season 5,5x10
25977,"No, I like Meredith.",Dwight,Season 5,5x10
25978,"Actually, I don't care for Meredith, but I don't believe in this kind of thing.  In the Schrute family we believe in a five fingered intervention. [holds up his fist] Awareness, education, control, acceptance and punching.",Dwight,Season 5,5x10
25979,Who is going to tell us the latest dirty joke?  Who is going to tell us what you watched on television last night?,Michael,Season 5,5x10
25981,"Was John Belushi fine?  Was Bob Hope fine?  Hey-- come here.  If anything ever happened to you, I would be very angry at myself for not doing all that I could do.",Michael,Season 5,5x10
25983,I want you to say I'm an alcoholic.,Michael,Season 5,5x10
25985,"You can say it as loudly as you want, but we're not going to believe you.",Michael,Season 5,5x10
25994,"[amid groans from the rest of the office] Alright, no, no, no.  No. That is the image, I think we can all agree is very disgusting.  But you know what, Meredith, you lit your hair on fire today.  What about tomorrow.?  What is going to happen when you come into work and you're dead?",Michael,Season 5,5x10
25995,I stab her in the brain with a wooden stick.,Dwight,Season 5,5x10
25996,"There are several ways to kill a zombie, but the most satisfying one is to stab it in the brain with a wooden stick.",Dwight,Season 5,5x10
25997,"Everyone in this room loves you, but mark my words, we are not going to support your alcoholism anymore.  The next time you light yourself on fire we are not going to help put you out.",Michael,Season 5,5x10
25998,"Oh, as fire marshal I would have to.",Dwight,Season 5,5x10
25999,Dwight--,Michael,Season 5,5x10
26000,She is a hazard to the other people of the office.,Dwight,Season 5,5x10
26001,[sighs]...okay.,Michael,Season 5,5x10
26002,I suppose I could do it if it was a controlled burn in a well ventilated area.,Dwight,Season 5,5x10
26003,"Yeah, but you're gonna need a permit for that.",Jim,Season 5,5x10
26004,"Oh right, that'll take a couple of weeks.",Dwight,Season 5,5x10
26006,Really?,Dwight,Season 5,5x10
26009,"Michael, I think... you did the best you could, but this is bigger than all of us.",Jim,Season 5,5x10
26010,"Enabler!  Enabler, enabler, enabler, enabler, enabler.  It's Christmas and we are turning our back on somebody who is asking for help.",Michael,Season 5,5x10
26011,"You know what the only thing I want for Christmas? I want Meredith to get better.  That's my only wish.  But you know what?  My wishes never come true, so I'm not going to wish that on her. I-- a watch would be nice.",Michael,Season 5,5x10
26012,[watching Meredith and Michael talk in his office] They've been in there for 45 minutes.,Jim,Season 5,5x10
26013,"I know.  If she wasn't an alcoholic before, she is now. [Jim laughs]",Pam,Season 5,5x10
26016,[Andy playing the sitar] Hey.,Jim,Season 5,5x10
26018,Do you take requests?,Jim,Season 5,5x10
26020,Please stop. People are having a Christmas party.,Jim,Season 5,5x10
26021,[whispers to Meredith] I'll be down in a minute. [walks over to Toby] Could you write down the number of that rehabilitation center that you mentioned?,Michael,Season 5,5x10
26024,We did?,Michael,Season 5,5x10
26026,"Oh, shoot.  Oh well, we'll have to go someplace else then I guess.",Michael,Season 5,5x10
26028,"We could go there, sure.",Michael,Season 5,5x10
26030,"Yes, yes.",Michael,Season 5,5x10
26032,I have a new place.,Michael,Season 5,5x10
26034,"It-- yep, recently.",Michael,Season 5,5x10
26036,All right.,Michael,Season 5,5x10
26038,"Yeah, oh there you go.",Michael,Season 5,5x10
26040,That's good.,Michael,Season 5,5x10
26042,We're party girls.,Michael,Season 5,5x10
26047,$200.00,Dwight,Season 5,5x10
26050,"Oh, that's my last one.",Dwight,Season 5,5x10
26054,Not my problem.,Dwight,Season 5,5x10
26065,It's okay. It's all right.,Michael,Season 5,5x10
26067,"Meredith, we are doing this for your own good.  Okay. Come on--",Michael,Season 5,5x10
26069,Here we go. This is gonna be good.,Michael,Season 5,5x10
26071,Yes you are. [tries to pull Meredith from the car],Michael,Season 5,5x10
26074,Shhh... just calm down.,Michael,Season 5,5x10
26076,[chasing Meredith] Come on. Shh...,Michael,Season 5,5x10
26078,Here's the door. Here's the door.,Michael,Season 5,5x10
26080,[dragging Meredith on the floor into the rehab center] Let's start meeting-- Hello. How are you?,Michael,Season 5,5x10
26083,I have a deposit.  Alcoholic.,Michael,Season 5,5x10
26085,So do I sign?,Michael,Season 5,5x10
26094,Well don't look so surprised.,Dwight,Season 5,5x10
26095,I knew it.,Pam,Season 5,5x10
26096,You did not know it.,Jim,Season 5,5x10
26097,I knew some of it.,Pam,Season 5,5x10
26098,Everyone knew some of it.,Jim,Season 5,5x10
26099,It's Christmas.,Pam,Season 5,5x10
26100,You knew it.,Jim,Season 5,5x10
26101,Thank you. I knew it.,Pam,Season 5,5x10
26102,She knew it.,Jim,Season 5,5x10
26103,As it turns out you can't just check someone into rehab against their will.  They have to do it voluntarily.  They have to hit rock bottom.  So I think I know what I need to do at this point.  I need to find ways to push Meredith to the bottom.  Um... I think I can do it.  I did it with Jan.,Michael,Season 5,5x10
26107,"[answering the phone] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. I'm sorry, he's not in yet. Would you like his voicemail?",Pam,Season 5,5x11

26112,Yes!,Dwight,Season 5,5x11
26113,"No. No, no. There was wind.",Michael,Season 5,5x11
26114,I was just jogging.,Dwight,Season 5,5x11
26115,"Dwight, there was wind. I want a do-over.",Michael,Season 5,5x11
26116,"No, no, no, it's not your turn. All right, thirteen is the new number. Oscar, go ahead.",Jim,Season 5,5x11
26117,I want another try. Here we go! [Michael runs past the radar as a car passes] Thirty-one! Thirty-one!,Michael,Season 5,5x11
26119,I was ahead of the car. Thirty-one is my new number.,Michael,Season 5,5x11
26121,"Go, Oscar. Thirty-one's my number.",Michael,Season 5,5x11
26123,Beat it!,Michael,Season 5,5x11
26124,"Today's a big day. My presence has been requested by [in an authoritative voice] Chief Financial Officer, David Wallace. [in normal voice] He says that he wants to talk about big picture stuff. And, I'll be honest, I have little or no idea what that means, so... probably bad.",Michael,Season 5,5x11
26125,"Quick announcement: new year, new candy.",Pam,Season 5,5x11
26127,"Okay, be careful, Kevin. They're kind of spicy.",Pam,Season 5,5x11

26137,You still don't know.,Michael,Season 5,5x11
26138,Why don't... Let's...,Jim,Season 5,5x11
26139,[to Jim] What are you doing?,Michael,Season 5,5x11
26140,How about we just... Just have to talk to you for a second...,Jim,Season 5,5x11
26141,Andy.,Michael,Season 5,5x11
26142,Ahh! [ushers Michael into his office],Jim,Season 5,5x11
26144,"[from inside his office] No, what I'm saying is...",Michael,Season 5,5x11
26145,"No, no.",Jim,Season 5,5x11
26146,"No, that's not it.",Michael,Season 5,5x11
26147,I know.,Jim,Season 5,5x11
26148,"Andy still doesn't know that Angela's having an affair with Dwight. And it's been seventeen days. I mean, eventually he'll figure it out, when their kids have giant heads and beet-stained teeth. But right now it's just... awkward.",Jim,Season 5,5x11
26149,[sighs] How can he still not know?,Michael,Season 5,5x11
26150,We can't figure that out.,Jim,Season 5,5x11
26151,I can't take it anymore.,Michael,Season 5,5x11

26782,"No, I will.",Michael,Season 5,5x13

26830,"How about no arms? No arms or legs is basically how you exist right now, Kevin. You don't do anything.",Michael,Season 5,5x13
26832,"okay, that's uh, hard to keep track.  How many is that per hour?",Michael,Season 5,5x13
26833,How's that gonna help you?,Jim,Season 5,5x13
26834,I will divide and then count to it.,Michael,Season 5,5x13

26930,My goal is to make this office as peaceful a place for Stanley Hudson as I can. I think sounds have a lot to do with that. Here are some downloaded peaceful sounds. [a couple of sounds play on the computer] That one makes me think... of death. It's kinda nice...,Michael,Season 5,5x13
26931,"[everyone is lying on the floor in the conference room with the light off, Michael is walking around with a candle in his hand] It is a beautiful, sunny day as we walk through the meadow that is very spiritual and relaxing and there are flowers and it is sunny and beautiful. Now, up ahead, a castle, in a distance.",Michael,Season 5,5x13
26932,Don't open your eyes.,Jim,Season 5,5x13
26933,"What? [opens her eyes, Michael is standing over her] Oh...",Pam,Season 5,5x13
26934,"And you walk up toward the castle, and inside the castle are 4 men, and each of them, none of them have shoes, and they give you a funny cigarette, and you feel even more relaxed, and then you want ice cream. You want a big bowl of ice cream. What kind do you want? Shout it out.",Michael,Season 5,5x13
26936,Too expensive.,Michael,Season 5,5x13
26938,"Racism is dead Stanley, you can have any kind of ice cream you want. What do you want? [beeping starts] What is that? People! Please I told you to get rid of the cell phones.",Michael,Season 5,5x13
26940,"Oh, ok. What is that, like, a video game?",Michael,Season 5,5x13
26942,You have stress?,Michael,Season 5,5x13

26952,Ok. [beeping slows down],Michael,Season 5,5x13
26954,"Ok... I think that thing is on the fritz. Ahh... Oscar, would you reach over and touch his thing? That's what HE said! Right guys, 'cause of gay? [Oscar has Stanley's monitor now] Let's give this a shot.",Michael,Season 5,5x13
26955,Hellloo... [beeping speeds up as Michael gets closer],Michael,Season 5,5x13
26957,So... it wasn't Dwight after all. Looks like I am the killer. You never expect that you're the killer... it's uh... great twist. Great twist.,Michael,Season 5,5x13
26958,"Dunder Mifflin this is Pam. Oh, hey Mom. No, what did Dad say?",Pam,Season 5,5x13
26959,What did you say to my dad?,Pam,Season 5,5x13
26960,What?,Jim,Season 5,5x13
26961,"After you talked, he called my mom and said he was gonna look for an apartment.",Pam,Season 5,5x13
26962,"Oh my God. Pam, I don't know, I, nothing, truly, nothing. I mean, I, I just was honest with him and I, I'm so sorry, I don't know. I'll call him again. [Pam rolls her eyes and walks away]",Jim,Season 5,5x13
26963,"Fifty percent of marriages end in divorce, so... it was her parents or my parents...",Jim,Season 5,5x13
26964,What could Jim have said to make my dad want to leave my mom? And at what point in our marriage is he gonna say it to me?,Pam,Season 5,5x13
26965,I don't get it. Do I stress you out?,Michael,Season 5,5x13
26966,Nothing stresses me out. Except having to seek the approval of my inferiors.,Dwight,Season 5,5x13
26967,Oh...,Michael,Season 5,5x13
26968,Speaking of which... [hands Michael the paper to sign for Dwight's formal apology],Dwight,Season 5,5x13
26969,"Remember when people used to say boss, when they were describing something that was really cool like, those shoulder pads are really boss man... Look at that perm, that perm is so boss. It's what made me want to become a boss. And I looked so good in a perm and shoulder pads. But now, boss is just slang for jerk in charge.",Michael,Season 5,5x13
26970,"Ok everybody, I've figured it out. The reason that you are all so stressed around me is that you are too intimidated to tell me what you really think. [Jim shakes his head at the camera] You are keeping these feelings inside, and that is what's causing stress. So, what is the solution? Solution is honesty, laughter, and comedy. In short...",Michael,Season 5,5x13
26972,"What? No. No, I am talking about a roast! Of Michael Scott! Oh c'mon! Who here has the Comedy Central Roast channel? You've seen it right? Everybody gets together, and everyone starts hurling insults at the one guy, and everybody's laughing, and everybody's hugging each other...",Michael,Season 5,5x13
26974,Si senor.,Michael,Season 5,5x13
26976,"It's not! It's not offensive during a roast! Anything goes! I want you guys to really get crackin on this. I want you to take me down. Don't hold back. I want you to really make fun of anything about me. It could be my race, could be the fact that I'm so fit, or I'm a womanizer... fair game. Whatever. I don't want to write your stuff for you, but I just want it to be good.",Michael,Season 5,5x13
26979,I can already feel people's stress starting to melt. I think they're very excited about paying their respects this way. I have got to make sure that YouTube comes down to tape this.,Michael,Season 5,5x13

If you're here for the Grabowski wedding, it is the second door on the left. [Creed looks around] So, we all know how these work, needs to get crazy, take your best shot. I am going to sit right here on my chair and... ah... whoever wants to come up and roast me, you may. [Angela jumps up] Ok... lower the mic for the midget.",Michael,Season 5,5x13

26999,Do ya?,Jim,Season 5,5x13
27000,No...,Michael,Season 5,5x13

27014,You're interrupting me. I'm trying to get your back.,Dwight,Season 5,5x13
27015,Idiot. Idiot! Idiot. Idiot.,Michael,Season 5,5x13
27016,Are you calling me an idiot?,Dwight,Season 5,5x13
27017,Idiot.,Michael,Season 5,5x13
27018,"Don't you ever talk to me that way. You pathetic, short little man. You don't have any friends, or any family, or any land. [clapping and whooing]",Dwight,Season 5,5x13
27019,"Well I just want to take a minute to talk to you all about something very serious. Once every hour, someone is involved in an internet scam. That man is Michael Scott. [laughter] He's supporting about 20 Nigerian princesses.",Pam,Season 5,5x13
27020,"Hey, ya know what? Forgive me for caring. Right?",Michael,Season 5,5x13
27021,"Well, ya know, Michael is a great delegator. He never does any work himself. Ever. And one time, I walked in on him naked, and his thing is so small. [quickly walks off stage] If it were an iPod it would be a shuffle! [clapping, laughter]",Pam,Season 5,5x13
27022,"Can I make just a little announcement. In a professional roast, usually the roaster will say something nice about the roastee after they're done, something about how much they love them, so, just, keep that in mind.",Michael,Season 5,5x13

27033,Jefferson.,Michael,Season 5,5x13
27036,"Haha ha. Thank you very much, thank you. That was great. Great job, great laughs. Really, really went after my intelligence there. [clears throat] Dozens of online IQ test might prove you wrong, but, and my thing isn't tiny, its average, so... get your facts straight. [clears throat again] So when I heard that there was going to be a roast in my honor, I thought [choking up, clears throat again] sorry. [laughs nervously] I think I have a frog in my throat. Um... [sigh] I decided to jot down some quick thoughts about you people, um, first up Phyllis and Kevin. Uh um... [Michael walks off stage, knocking over the snare drum]",Michael,Season 5,5x13
27037,"Dunder Mifflin this is Pam. Uh, I'm sorry, Michael's not here right now can I take a message? Great. I will. Thanks.",Pam,Season 5,5x13
27038,"It's very unusual for Michael not to show up to work. My guess? He's either deeply depressed, or an icicle has snapped off his roof and impaled his brain. He has this terrible habit of standing directly underneath them and staring up at them. And I always say Michael, take two steps back, and stare at the icicle from the side. And he's like no, I like the way they look from standing directly underneath them.",Dwight,Season 5,5x13
27043,Attention everyone I just got a text from Michael. He says personnel day. Are we hiring?,Dwight,Season 5,5x13

27052,"You know sometimes, to get perspective, I like to think about a spaceman on a star incredibly far away. And, our problems don't matter to him, because we're just a distant point of light. But he feels sorry for me, because he has an incredibly powerful microscope, and he can see my face. [looks towards the sky] I'm okay. No, I'm not.",Michael,Season 5,5x13
27053,Phyllis there's a package for you.,Pam,Season 5,5x13

27060,So what did he say? Was it my fault?,Jim,Season 5,5x13
27061,"Yeah. He said that you told him how much you love me. About how you feel when I walk in a room, and about how, you've never doubted for a second that I'm the woman you want to spend the rest of your life with. I guess he's never felt that with my mom, even at their best.",Pam,Season 5,5x13

27063,Yeah. [they hug],Pam,Season 5,5x13
27064,"When you're a kid you assume your parents are soul mates. My kids are gonna be right about that. I guess it also means that sometimes love affairs look different to the people inside them. [Andy is in the background, looks incredulous]",Pam,Season 5,5x13

27607,"Just about everyone in this office is single right now.   Including me.  And everyone is experiencing an incredible amount of emotional pain.

27752,"These people need love and I am going to get it for them  Who cares if we sell a little bit less paper today?  A great boss cares more about the happiness of his employees then anything else.

27778,"You shouldn't believe everything you hear.  In fact, there are many knots that I cannot untie.  So where does a woman as charming as yourself find herself employed on a day such as today.",Dwight,Season 5,5x16
27780,You must use a lot of paper.,Dwight,Season 5,5x16
27782,What's the rule about eating when people are in the bathroom?,Pam,Season 5,5x16

27924,Too many words. Good ideas are simple. 'Golden ticket.',Michael,Season 5,5x17
27925,Free paper.',Jim,Season 5,5x17
27926,No. Jim. We're a business. Post-its. That is a golden ticket idea. NASA took five or six golden ticket ideas to get man on the moon.,Michael,Season 5,5x17
27928,"No, you don't. No, it - [sighs] What will be the state of this company if I am the only one coming up with the great ideas? Right?",Michael,Season 5,5x17
27935,What are you doing?,Jim,Season 5,5x17
27937,"[to Kevin] Why don't you just go out on a date with her? Try to spark up an on going joke and then in a month or two, if it feels right, you'll know.",Jim,Season 5,5x17
27939,"You don't have to wait that long. I mean, you don't have to wait a month to ask her out. Just ask her out.",Pam,Season 5,5x17
27941,What power?,Jim,Season 5,5x17
27944,That's psychotic. Do guys actually do that?,Pam,Season 5,5x17
27945,Well guys with girlfriends don't.,Jim,Season 5,5x17
27947,"[on phone] Hey, Tom. What's that? Oh, you found a golden ticket. [puts hand on receiver and speaks to office] One of my clients found a golden ticket. [Michael screams in excitement] [Jim back on phone] Yup. No, congratulations. [Michael dances in background]",Jim,Season 5,5x17
27948,Woo hoo.,Michael,Season 5,5x17
27949,[on phone] I'll take that down right now.,Jim,Season 5,5x17
27950,Tell me; was it a spoiled little girl with big lips...,Michael,Season 5,5x17
27951,I'm on the phone.,Jim,Season 5,5x17
27952,...or an odd little boy with a cowboy obsession?,Michael,Season 5,5x17
27953,[on phone] Hold on one second.,Jim,Season 5,5x17
27954,Invite them on the tour.,Michael,Season 5,5x17
27955,[to Michael] It's actually Blue Cross from Pennsylvania.,Jim,Season 5,5x17
27956,"Really? That's kind of a big client. [gets up and heads toward Oscar] Hey, Oscar. Woo hoo hoo. Um, how much of a hit is ten percent of our Blue Cross account?",Michael,Season 5,5x17
27958,Yeah?,Michael,Season 5,5x17
27960,Yeah.,Michael,Season 5,5x17
27962,"[on phone] Hold on one sec. Hold on one sec, Tom, what's that? You found five golden tickets? And does it say limit one per customer? Nope, it doesn't.",Jim,Season 5,5x17
27963,How do you not spread out the tickets into different shipments?,Jim,Season 5,5x17
27964,I thought I did. So...,Michael,Season 5,5x17
27965,OK...,Jim,Season 5,5x17
27966,Well no harm no foul.,Michael,Season 5,5x17
27967,...well I'm going to call corporate to make sure that they know I didn't lose half my sales.,Jim,Season 5,5x17
27968,"You didn't, but... it'll be fine. It'll be good.",Michael,Season 5,5x17
27969,Hey. Hey. Hey. You idiot.,Michael,Season 5,5x17
27971,Sir. I placed a bunch of golden tickets into five separate boxes and some how they all ended up with Blue Cross. How does this happen?,Michael,Season 5,5x17
27973,Irrelevant.,Michael,Season 5,5x17
27975,"OK, I'm going to ask you something and I want you to be honest. What is a pallet?",Michael,Season 5,5x17
27976,My golden ticket idea? OK. Why would anyone think that this is my golden ticket idea? There is a one in 13 chance that this could be anybody's golden ticket idea. [sighs] That... [sighs],Michael,Season 5,5x17
27977,"Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh hi ,David. [Michael shakes his head to Pam] No, I'm sorry he's not back from the Civil Rights rally. I'll have him call you the minute he gets back from the Lincoln Memorial.",Pam,Season 5,5x17
27978,"When Michael's skirting a phone call, he gave me a list of places to say he is. 'Stopping a fight in the parking lot. ' 'An Obama fashion show. ' Whatever... that is. Or 'trapped in an oil painting.' I'm gonna save that one.",Pam,Season 5,5x17
27979,"Nobody panic. The good news is... they can't fire all of us, right?",Michael,Season 5,5x17
27981,"No, they can't.",Michael,Season 5,5x17
27983,"Oscar, you don't know what the hell you are talking about.",Michael,Season 5,5x17
27985,"Alright, then we're screwed. I am just a net that traps all of your crappy subconscious ideas and adds a little bit of my own childhood memories and whimsy, so -",Michael,Season 5,5x17
27986,"So, well I lost a ton of money today and I have a mortgage, so I'm a little pissed too.",Jim,Season 5,5x17
27987,"Thank you, Jim is with me.",Michael,Season 5,5x17
27988,"Absolutely not, I'm mad at you.",Jim,Season 5,5x17
27989,Well you know what Jim? It is not my fault that you bought a house to impress Pam. That is why carnations exist.,Michael,Season 5,5x17
27991,"OK, we need a gold ticket idea to get us out of this mess. [Pam raises hand] Yes.",Michael,Season 5,5x17
27992,Does that mean an idea that blows up in our faces later? [Pam's phone rings],Pam,Season 5,5x17
27993,Good one.,Jim,Season 5,5x17
27994,"OK, don't get that. Please? [Pam gets up to answer her phone]",Michael,Season 5,5x17
27996,That is not constructive.,Michael,Season 5,5x17
27997,"[on phone] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh hi, David. He's having a colonoscopy. Alright, I'll find out if he's out yet.",Pam,Season 5,5x17
27998,"[on phone] Hello David. I just got back from my procedure, so--",Michael,Season 5,5x17
28000,How are you doing?,Michael,Season 5,5x17
28002,[reading from computer] My colonoscopy was an examination of my large colon and the distal part of my small bowel with a camera.,Michael,Season 5,5x17
28004,"Well, there is an explanation that involves me not letting it happen and I just don't... I don't know.",Michael,Season 5,5x17
28006,I think we might have hired an outside marketing consultant.,Michael,Season 5,5x17
28008,You're breaking up.,Michael,Season 5,5x17
28010,"OK, I think, it might have been an inside consultant.",Michael,Season 5,5x17
28012,Yes.,Michael,Season 5,5x17
28014,No.,Michael,Season 5,5x17
28016,[long pause] Yes.,Michael,Season 5,5x17
28017,"[Dwight walks in] Come on in. Good to see ya, have a seat. I just wanted to congratulate you on that great golden ticket idea.",Michael,Season 5,5x17
28018,That was your idea.,Dwight,Season 5,5x17
28019,"Woah, wow, who told you that?",Michael,Season 5,5x17
28020,You did. Several times. Over and over again.,Dwight,Season 5,5x17
28021,"[same time as Dwight] No, I don't think I ever did. That was your idea Dwight.",Michael,Season 5,5x17
28022,[same time as Michael] You were dressed as Willy Wonka so...,Dwight,Season 5,5x17
28023,I'm not taking... I'm not taking...,Michael,Season 5,5x17
28024,Wasn't my idea. Loved - but I can't.,Dwight,Season 5,5x17
28025,"Wait a second, wait a second, I wrote it down in my diary.",Michael,Season 5,5x17
28026,You don't keep a diary.,Dwight,Season 5,5x17
28027,Yes I do. You've just never seen it. [reading from diary] March 4th. Dwight came up with the best idea today about golden tickets.,Michael,Season 5,5x17
28028,Hold that thought. [Dwight gets up and gets own diary from desk and returns] [flipping through diary] March... 4th. Michael Scott came up with golden ticket idea to give five customers ten perfect off for one year.,Dwight,Season 5,5x17
28029,Why do you have a diary?,Michael,Season 5,5x17
28030,To keep secrets from my computer.,Dwight,Season 5,5x17
28031,"OK, you know what? You came up with this idea. I remember you told me that you loved the Willy Wonka movie when you were growing up.",Michael,Season 5,5x17
28032,Impossible.,Dwight,Season 5,5x17
28033,"Yes, you did.",Michael,Season 5,5x17
28034,"I wasn't given candy as a child, so a movie that fetish-ized it that much, would have made no sense to me. Plus, we weren't allowed to see movies. So... do the math.",Dwight,Season 5,5x17
28035,What are you writing? [Dwight writes in diary],Michael,Season 5,5x17
28036,Had conversation with Michael about taking credit for an idea that wasn't mine. Discussed movies.,Dwight,Season 5,5x17
28037,Would you like to go to lunch with me? Just the two of us?,Michael,Season 5,5x17
28038,With all my heart.,Dwight,Season 5,5x17
28040,"All I'm saying is that it's a first dates, so just keep a respectful distance.",Jim,Season 5,5x17
28042,I don't think Jim means to say that you shouldn't touch her.,Pam,Season 5,5x17
28043,"No, that is what I mean.",Jim,Season 5,5x17
28044,"[to Jim] Shush. [to Kevin] Kevin, a playful touch on the arm, or on the back, it can show your interest and it's really romantic.",Pam,Season 5,5x17
28046,"No, stop it.",Jim,Season 5,5x17
28049,We think a lot alike. Sometimes you will think something and I will say what you're thinking--,Michael,Season 5,5x17
28050,"OK, what am I thinking right now?",Dwight,Season 5,5x17
28051,"Umm, nacho chips.",Michael,Season 5,5x17
28052,No... How skin is the largest organ of the body.,Dwight,Season 5,5x17
28053,"Oh, OK. Let me just cut to the chase, Dwight. I want you to fall on your sword for me.",Michael,Season 5,5x17
28054,"Oh, not gonna happen.",Dwight,Season 5,5x17
28055,I did fall on my sword once. I was running with it in my belt. Won't happen again.,Dwight,Season 5,5x17
28056,"Why do you even want to stay at Dunder Mifflin? I mean what's the point? You're cooped up in there all day. You don't get to do your farming. You're not dating Angela anymore. It doesn't matter if you get fired for taking credit for the gold ticket idea. It doesn't matter. Me on the other hand, I would be lost without this place. You, way too manly.",Michael,Season 5,5x17
28057,What about Shoe La La?,Dwight,Season 5,5x17
28058,[sighs] It's not ready yet.,Michael,Season 5,5x17
28059,"I have an idea for a fancy men's shoe store called Shoe La La. And it's just men's shoes for the special occasions in a man's life, like the day that you get married or the day your wife has a baby, or for just lounging around the house.",Michael,Season 5,5x17
28060,"May I have your attention please. I have an announcement. Mr. Dwight Schrute and I just returned from a wonderful stroll together and although I probably will never do it again, I had fun. I really had fun with my best friend, Dwight.",Michael,Season 5,5x17
28062,"Yes they are, you just don't care about the information.",Michael,Season 5,5x17
28063,I love working here and I do not want to leave.,Dwight,Season 5,5x17
28064,He doesn't love it that much. Wouldn't be such a bad thing for him to be fired.,Michael,Season 5,5x17
28065,Well...,Dwight,Season 5,5x17
28066,"I mean, like we were talking about that is why he has come to the conclusion...",Michael,Season 5,5x17
28067,We discussed the fact that I'm cooped up here instead of experiencing the whole wide world.,Dwight,Season 5,5x17
28068,Right.,Michael,Season 5,5x17
28069,No plowing my own acres. Going around shirtless all day. You know experiencing freedom.,Dwight,Season 5,5x17
28070,That's it. That's it. You can't put a price on freedom.,Michael,Season 5,5x17
28071,Try me.,Dwight,Season 5,5x17
28072,That's why you made the decision. That's why you made...,Michael,Season 5,5x17
28073,I haven't made a decision yet.,Dwight,Season 5,5x17
28074,You kind of have.,Michael,Season 5,5x17
28075,No.,Dwight,Season 5,5x17
28076,Yes.,Michael,Season 5,5x17
28077,You cannot take the fall for him.,Jim,Season 5,5x17
28078,He said he would do the same for me.,Dwight,Season 5,5x17
28079,He can do the same for you. Right now. By getting fired instead of you. So what are you gonna do?,Jim,Season 5,5x17
28080,I'm gonna go back to work. After I write you up for insubordination.,Dwight,Season 5,5x17
28081,There it is.,Jim,Season 5,5x17
28082,"[seeing David Wallace come into the office] Oh my God. Dwight! Dwight! Get in--- what's it gonna be, what are you gonna do? [Dwight runs into Michael's office] What's it gonna be? Are you gonna do this thing for me? Dwight? [David knocks on Michael's door and opens door] Hey David, how are you? Good to see you. Nice surprise. Dwight and I were just having a very unfortunate conversation.",Michael,Season 5,5x17
28084,"Yes it is, but it had to be done, didn't it?",Michael,Season 5,5x17
28086,David... you're welcome. [Dwight and David shake hands and make exclamations],Dwight,Season 5,5x17
28089,That's what she said! [David laughs],Dwight,Season 5,5x17
28090,"Hey, Dwight, great idea. Dwight, Dwight, great idea. How'd you come up with that idea?",Michael,Season 5,5x17
28091,Inspiration.,Dwight,Season 5,5x17
28092,Really? How did-- how are you inspired?  How did it pop into your head Dwight?,Michael,Season 5,5x17
28093,[same time as Michael] You never know when it's gonna strike. Just... boom.,Dwight,Season 5,5x17
28094,Give me the details of how that happened.,Michael,Season 5,5x17
28095,"You, you are taking about Dwight Schrute. The biggest Wonka fan I know. I mean, you've been talking about that movie for years.",Jim,Season 5,5x17
28096,What?,Michael,Season 5,5x17
28097,And you know what? I even made fun of you when you dressed up as Willy Wonka to pitch this idea and for that I apologize.,Jim,Season 5,5x17
28098,Apology rejected.,Dwight,Season 5,5x17
28099,"[going up to give Dwight a hug] Thanks for much for helping the company, Dwight.",Pam,Season 5,5x17
28100,Oh Pam.,Dwight,Season 5,5x17
28102,Thanks old man.,Dwight,Season 5,5x17
28104,Yeah.,Dwight,Season 5,5x17
28106,Sure.,Pam,Season 5,5x17
28107,David? David?,Michael,Season 5,5x17
28108,[same time as Michael] 'Cause I've got this idea...,Dwight,Season 5,5x17
28109,David?,Michael,Season 5,5x17
28111,Could I be a part of the meeting also?,Michael,Season 5,5x17
28113,"Yeah, let's face it. This meeting sounds like it's Wonka fans only. He's never seen the movie. [David laughs]",Jim,Season 5,5x17
28114,Alright.,Dwight,Season 5,5x17
28116,"OK guys, listen up. Here's the deal. I love candy. Sweet sugary candy from the second it touches my tongue to the moment it's metabolized by my stomach acids, so naturally I liked Willy Wonka.",Dwight,Season 5,5x17
28119,So I love Willy Wonka. That golden ticket scene is so inspiring to me that that's where I cam up with that idea [Michael comes into conference room].,Dwight,Season 5,5x17
28120,There is no movie called Willy Wonka. It's called Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.,Michael,Season 5,5x17
28121,It's actually based on a book called Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.,Pam,Season 5,5x17
28122,Pam...,Dwight,Season 5,5x17
28123,I can't... vouch for that. But I do know this. He is a liar. He has taken my idea.,Michael,Season 5,5x17
28124,That is my idea.,Dwight,Season 5,5x17
28126,"OK, here's what happened, David. It was all my idea. You called me and you were really angry at me and I got scared, so I had Dwight take the fall, but now, it turns out that it's a great idea and Dwight will not confess. Can you believe that?",Michael,Season 5,5x17
28128,It is my idea.,Dwight,Season 5,5x17
28129,Oh how dare you.,Michael,Season 5,5x17
28130,It is my idea. I'm filled with good ideas. Thousands of good ideas.,Dwight,Season 5,5x17
28131,"You are? Good ideas, huh? Hey, did you come up with toilet buddy? It's a net, circular net, that you put inside the toilet to catch all of your change and your wallet from falling into the toilet? Formally known as toilet guard?",Michael,Season 5,5x17
28132,Horse Boat.,Dwight,Season 5,5x17
28133,Oh please.,Michael,Season 5,5x17
28134,A canoe built around your horse so you can go from riding to water travel without slowing down. Horse Boat!,Dwight,Season 5,5x17
28135,Toilet sponge. It's a hollowed out sponge...,Michael,Season 5,5x17
28136,Oh give me a break.,Dwight,Season 5,5x17
28137,"...that is more absorbent, and softer than toilet paper. I have a lot of toilet ideas.",Michael,Season 5,5x17
28138,That's because they're easy!,Dwight,Season 5,5x17
28139,They're not easy. Everybody has to go to the bathroom.,Michael,Season 5,5x17
28140,[same time as Michael] Women's urinals... uh...,Dwight,Season 5,5x17
28142,"Yes, it's Michael's idea that he forced on me on threat of death.",Dwight,Season 5,5x17
28143,Thank You!,Michael,Season 5,5x17
28145,"Well David, I will be honest with you. I do want the credit without any of the blame.",Michael,Season 5,5x17
28147,OK.,Pam,Season 5,5x17
28149,When they look back on this day in the history books all that will be remembered is that I had a good idea. And that's what I am going to write down in my diary. That is what I want you to write down in yours.,Michael,Season 5,5x17
28150,Oh I am. In my own words.,Dwight,Season 5,5x17
28151,I want to see it.,Michael,Season 5,5x17
28152,No.,Dwight,Season 5,5x17
28153,I want to see it. [Michael gets up to try to see Dwight's diary],Michael,Season 5,5x17
28154,"No, Michael.",Dwight,Season 5,5x17
28155,Give me...  Give me the diary.,Michael,Season 5,5x17
28156,No! [Michael struggles to take Dwight's diary from his hand],Dwight,Season 5,5x17
28164,Ding dong.,Dwight,Season 5,5x17
28165,Who is it?,Jim,Season 5,5x17
28166,KGB.,Dwight,Season 5,5x17
28167,"Alright. I just got out of the shower, I'll be one second.",Jim,Season 5,5x17
28168,"[in accent] When you are done, open the door. ... Hello in there?",Dwight,Season 5,5x17
28169,"Yeah, I'm late for work, so I have to brush my teeth, it's a whole routine.",Jim,Season 5,5x17
28170,We have more houses to visit.,Dwight,Season 5,5x17
28171,"If you want to come back then, that'll be fine.",Jim,Season 5,5x17
28172,We will come back at... how is [looks at watch] 4:45?,Dwight,Season 5,5x17
28173,I get back from work around 6.,Jim,Season 5,5x17
28174,How about 5:15?,Dwight,Season 5,5x17
28175,"You can try. That, that might work.",Jim,Season 5,5x17
28176,"Very well, we will come back at 5:15.",Dwight,Season 5,5x17
28177,Alright.,Jim,Season 5,5x17
28178,"Michael, since it is your fifteenth anniversary at the company, I thought it might be appropriate to begin the festivities with a fifteen-minute round of applause.",Dwight,Season 5,5x18
28179,I like it.,Michael,Season 5,5x18
28180,Followed by a fifteen minute moment of silence.,Dwight,Season 5,5x18
28181,[wearing a tuxedo] I don't know. Is it classy enough?,Jim,Season 5,5x18
28182,"Jim! Enough with the classy, ok?",Dwight,Season 5,5x18
28183,"I just feel like after fifteen years at this company, bravo by the way, that we should celebrate with a very classy event, a night to remember.",Jim,Season 5,5x18
28184,"I think you're right. This party has to have all the excitement, drama and intrigue of my time here.",Michael,Season 5,5x18
28185,"And of course, classy.",Jim,Season 5,5x18
28186,"And classy, yeah.",Michael,Season 5,5x18
28187,"Michael, you're just agreeing with him because he's wearing a tux. Don't you see what he's doing here?",Dwight,Season 5,5x18
28188,"Last week, Dwight sent out a memo about the dress code. So, this is me showing him that I'm taking it very seriously.",Jim,Season 5,5x18
28189,"Oh, here's one:  a string quartet, playing classy-cal music. [Jim grimaces]",Dwight,Season 5,5x18
28190,"[watches Jim grimace, copies him] You know, that's good but it's not classy. I-I need something classy like the opening of a car dealership.",Michael,Season 5,5x18
28191,That's it. Or Mr. Peanut.,Jim,Season 5,5x18
28192,Yes.,Michael,Season 5,5x18
28193,Mr. Peanut is not classy.,Dwight,Season 5,5x18
28194,He is.,Michael,Season 5,5x18
28195,"He is a regular peanut. He just happens to have a cane, a monocle and a top hat.",Dwight,Season 5,5x18
28196,That's what makes him classy.,Michael,Season 5,5x18
28197,"Ok, how about this? An ice sculpture, shaped like you, covered in chocolate-covered strawberries.",Dwight,Season 5,5x18
28198,"Oh, Dwight, you're trying too hard, and that's just not classy. You see, the thing about classy is it's a state of mind.",Jim,Season 5,5x18
28199,"Well, I'm sorry, I just don't know what classy is then.",Dwight,Season 5,5x18
28200,"Ok, well let's just try this one on for size. And I apologize because it's right off the top of my head:  an ice sculpture. Of you. Completely surrounded by a variety of chocolate-covered fruits.",Jim,Season 5,5x18
28201,Strawberries?,Michael,Season 5,5x18
28202,That's inspired.,Jim,Season 5,5x18
28203,"I said that! [storms out, slams door behind him]",Dwight,Season 5,5x18
28204,Not classy.,Pam,Season 5,5x18
28205,Not classy at all.,Michael,Season 5,5x18
28206,De class'.,Jim,Season 5,5x18
28207,French. Classy.,Michael,Season 5,5x18

28211,[on speakerphone] Yes?,Michael,Season 5,5x18
28212,"Michael, there's a Charles Miner here to see you.",Pam,Season 5,5x18
28213,Miner? I hardly know her!... Hello?,Michael,Season 5,5x18
28214,"Yeah, are you coming out now?",Pam,Season 5,5x18

28435,"Do you talk to him about this? You've talked to him all day, obviously. Did you talk to him about this?",Michael,Season 5,5x18
28437,"Ok. Then I don't get it. It doesn't make any sense to me. Because I thought in the new system I was supposed to talk to Charles, and then Charles was supposed to talk to you, and that would dilute any need for me to ever talk to you again.",Michael,Season 5,5x18
28439,Clearly that's what you wanted.,Michael,Season 5,5x18

29026,I can't do this.,Pam,Season 5,5x20
29027,What's that?,Michael,Season 5,5x20

29037,"So what are our options? Well, we can start this paper company. We can try. Or... that's it. That's our only option. Because we quit. Pam, I do my best work when people don't believe in me. I remember in high school, my math teacher told me I was gonna flunk out. And know what I did? The very next day I went out and I scored more goals than anyone else in the history of the hockey team. See what I mean? I thrive on this. I thrive on it. So I'm gonna go inside. I'm going to make some calls, I'm gonna get us an office space, and I'm going to show you why you joined this company. Okay?

29057,"You realize you're not actually talking to me, right?",Jim,Season 5,5x21
29062,"The new receptionist is also named Kelly. So Kelly Kapoor has decided to hover around my desk, so that she can run into his Charles' office every time he calls for Kelly. She thinks if she says 'You wanted me' enough, he will in fact want her. It's not the worse plan she's ever had.",Jim,Season 5,5x21

29072,"We wait, and hope that people show up to the pancake luncheon.",Michael,Season 5,5x21
29073,"I don't know I think we've done absolutely everything you can do to prepare for the day. I've updated our contacts, I have gotten quotes from suppliers.

But of that group, 782 have viewed it.",Michael,Season 5,5x21

29348,Am I going down a road?,Jim,Season 5,5x22

29353,"Ed's Tires. Why don't you tell them that we have fewer clients, so we can spend more time with each of them. Also, try to discuss it over Indian food, and try to mention how you distrust women.",Michael,Season 5,5x22
29354,I'm not gonna do that.,Pam,Season 5,5x22
29355,That is smart. That would not seem genuine. Ryan?,Michael,Season 5,5x22
29357,"Good, you take the lead on this one. Also, do not forget that he has just gone through a messy divorce.",Michael,Season 5,5x22

29377,Oh n- Is it Mose? Did you put the cover on that well?,Michael,Season 5,5x22

29381,"Personal hero, cool new guy. Okay, I think I'm getting your drift.",Michael,Season 5,5x22
29382,"Good, do you see what I'm saying?",Dwight,Season 5,5x22

29390,It is the situation that we are in now.,Dwight,Season 5,5x22

29566,That's very rude.,Michael,Season 5,5x22

29581,"How is Tom, the homosexual sophomore?",Dwight,Season 5,5x22
29582,"I wanted to start a company, not a war. Because in a war, you always fight those you are closest to. And the great tragedy of the civil war is that brother fought against brother. For what? What purpose did that serve? Apart from abolishing slavery? In that case, war was the right choice. This doesn't feel as important though. That's just how the world works, I guess.",Michael,Season 5,5x22

29639,Why would I love that? Can we afford a delivery guy?,Pam,Season 5,5x23

29641,"Yeah, I know what a loft is.",Pam,Season 5,5x23
29643,Most do in the magazines.,Michael,Season 5,5x23

29705,"Hi, Jerry.  Michael Scott.  Well, this is slightly embarrassing. [laughs] Um, I'm going to have to... ask you to pay me a little bit more money for that delivery we dropped off yesterday.

29805,Are you kidding me?  That is insultingly low.  I don't even want to hear what your first offer was.,Michael,Season 5,5x23
29809,I'll see your situation and I'll raise you a situation.  Your company is losing clients left and right.  You have a stockholder meeting coming up and you're going to have to explain to them why your most profitable branch is bleeding.  So they may be looking for a little change in the CFO.  So I don't think I need to wait out Dunder Mifflin.  I think I just have to wait out you.,Michael,Season 5,5x23

29912,"Wait, what?",Dwight,Season 5,5x24
29914,"It's going to work very smoothly, because Pam and Ryan are bringing over a ton of clients from Michael Scott Paper Company and--",Michael,Season 5,5x24
29916,"Yeah , aren't we getting those clients back?",Dwight,Season 5,5x24
29917,"No, you lost those clients.",Michael,Season 5,5x24

29945,When held over heat the invisible ink will reveal that everyone should meet at the warehouse immediately.  Do not ask me where I got the invisible ink.  Urine.  It was urine.,Dwight,Season 5,5x24
29952,"Okay, what are you still doing at your desk?",Dwight,Season 5,5x24
29954,Did you even read the memo?,Dwight,Season 5,5x24

29958,"Stop doing rhyming poetry.  Just tell them, please.  God, the simplest thing.",Dwight,Season 5,5x24
29959,"We're in crisis mode here, do you understand?  The two unqualified so-called salespeople are being favored because they all failed together.  And frankly, I'm not convinced that Michael and Pam didn't have a thing going while they were gone.",Dwight,Season 5,5x24
29960,Can I address that?,Jim,Season 5,5x24
29961,"No, you're too close.",Dwight,Season 5,5x24

29977,"No, pictures are too interpretive.",Dwight,Season 5,5x24
29978,"Can I just say something?  I know that tempers are high, but I think the best way to handle this might be to just talk to Michael directly.",Jim,Season 5,5x24
29979,"Oh.  Well, that--that's a great idea, Jim.  Oh, I totally see your point.  Okay, we'll talk to Michael directly.  So uh,  meeting is over, I guess.  I'll see everyone upstairs.",Dwight,Season 5,5x24

29993,Against who?,Michael,Season 5,5x24
29995,What?,Pam,Season 5,5x24

30110,That's fair.,Dwight,Season 5,5x24
30111,You are not reacting at all as I had hoped.,Michael,Season 5,5x24
30114,He can only keep one of us as a salesperson now.  He'll make his decision by the end of the day.,Pam,Season 5,5x24

30127,[puts Scrabble pieces on board] And Bingo was his name.  Let's go.,Michael,Season 5,5x24
30129,I need your help.  This whole Pam/Ryan debate is screwing with my head.,Michael,Season 5,5x24

30134,"Well, that's--",Jim,Season 5,5x24
30135,I like his hair.,Michael,Season 5,5x24
30136,"Cons, Ryan.  He defrauded the company.  He has never made a sale.",Jim,Season 5,5x24
30137,Okay.,Michael,Season 5,5x24
30138,He definitely stole my iPod.,Jim,Season 5,5x24
30139,That sounds pretty biased.,Michael,Season 5,5x24
30140,You didn't hear my pros.  Environmentally-conscious 'cause his mom drives him to work everyday.,Jim,Season 5,5x24
30141,"Okay. Pam, pros.",Michael,Season 5,5x24
30142,Mm-hmm.,Jim,Season 5,5x24
30143,"I like her.  I think that she is a fast learner.  Cons, she doesn't always follow through.  Sh--New York and the whole art school thing.  And Roy.  She has a weird voice.",Michael,Season 5,5x24
30144,That's not true.,Jim,Season 5,5x24
30145,I don't need to tell you that.,Michael,Season 5,5x24
30146,I think she'd be a really good salesperson.,Jim,Season 5,5x24
30147,"I don't think you are being totally impartial though, because you haven't said one bad thing about Pam.",Michael,Season 5,5x24
30148,And I won't.,Jim,Season 5,5x24
30149,"Okay.  So be it, then you've lost credibility.  And I'm going to go with my guy, and that's Ryan.",Michael,Season 5,5x24
30150,"All right.  You're right, sometimes when she's tired, she can be a little bit shrill.  But that's not a weird voice.",Jim,Season 5,5x24
30151,"Oh, wow!  Whoa!",Michael,Season 5,5x24
30152,Take it easy.,Jim,Season 5,5x24

30154,I have a very difficult decision to make.  It's like last week I was at the video store.  Do I rent Devil Wears Prada again? Or do I finally get around to seeing Sophie's Choice?  It is what you would call a classic difficult decision.,Michael,Season 5,5x24
30157,"Listen up, Flenderson.  You're being weak and ineffectual.  I'm cowboying this meeting, okay?  Here are the new rules.  Earth tones only.  Also, women are forbidden to wear pants.",Dwight,Season 5,5x24

30161,That's debatable.,Dwight,Season 5,5x24
30167,"Pam, can you come in here, please?  Have a seat.  [clears throat] Well, there's no easy way of saying this.  So I think I will just...drag it out.  Since the dawn of time there has been--",Michael,Season 5,5x24
30168,Just tell me.,Pam,Season 5,5x24

30188,What about Ryan?,Pam,Season 5,5x24
30189,"I don't know, I offered him his temp job back.  We'll see.  He was not happy at all when I offered him this job and then I told him he didn't get the job, so--",Michael,Season 5,5x24
30190,Yeah.  Maybe you shouldn't fake fire people anymore.,Pam,Season 5,5x24

30245,So someone is going to a court. Big deal.,Pam,Season 5,5x25
30246,"It is a big deal. Cause there's only a handful of reasons why someone would ever go to a courthouse in Ohio and not be charged with a crime. To claim an inheritance from a deceased relative.

30841,"I hate, hate, hate being left out. Whether it's not being picked for a team, or being picked for a team and showing up and realizing the team doesn't exist. Or that the sport doesn't exist? I should've known. Poopball?",Michael,Season 6,6x1
30842,"[to Maurie, the Asian intern] Man, I know how you feel. Third wheel. I have been the third wheel so many times in my life. My mom told me something once that made me feel a lot better. She said 'The third wheel is what makes it a tricycle.'",Michael,Season 6,6x1
30844,I'm talking about your group date with Megan and Eric.,Michael,Season 6,6x1
30846,Yes,Michael,Season 6,6x1
30848,Well...,Michael,Season 6,6x1
30850,[confused] Stanley was on your group date?,Michael,Season 6,6x1
30852,[laughs] Does anybody else know about this?,Michael,Season 6,6x1
30854,"[laughs, looks to camera excitedly]",Michael,Season 6,6x1
30855,"There he goes. There he goes. [Stanley gets up from his desk, walks into kitchen area]",Michael,Season 6,6x1
30856,"So, what is the scuttlebutt? Anybody hear anything?",Michael,Season 6,6x1
30858,Nothing? Well I got a little somethin' somethin'. I don't know if I should say...,Michael,Season 6,6x1
30859,Just keep it to yourself then.,Pam,Season 6,6x1
30860,Stanly is having a midlife crisis.,Michael,Season 6,6x1
30861,Stanley's way past the middle of his life. Especially considering his height to weight ratio.,Dwight,Season 6,6x1
30862,"Well apparently, he and his wife were out dancing at a club for young people.",Michael,Season 6,6x1
30864,Who?,Michael,Season 6,6x1
30866,"[starts to speak, says nothing, walks away]",Michael,Season 6,6x1
30867,"[entering break room, to Maurie] You stupid son of a bitch. You set me up.",Michael,Season 6,6x1
30869,Stanley's wife is out of town.,Michael,Season 6,6x1
30872,"Oh, was he? Well who, his sister?",Michael,Season 6,6x1
30874,[upset] I don't get it!,Michael,Season 6,6x1
30876,Drugs?,Michael,Season 6,6x1
30878,[fumbling for words] Mmm... okay. Uhh... hmm... okay. Never mind. Carry on.,Michael,Season 6,6x1
30879,"[approaching Kelly's desk, whispering] Stanley is having an affir.",Michael,Season 6,6x1
30881,"I am very happy right now. Thrilled perhaps, to be part of the office, to be part of the conversation. When you have somebody's attenton, and their eyes are lighting up because they are very interested in what you have to say, [Michael is seen whispering to Jim, then Pam] that is a great feeling, and I experienced that firsthand today. It is wonderful to be the center of attention.",Michael,Season 6,6x1
30882,"[motioning to pad of paper with hangman game, spelling out  'S_an_ey is chea_in_ _n _eri] That and that are the same letter.",Michael,Season 6,6x1
30884,"No... no. He's holding a pencil. He could be doing a crossword puzzle with that pencil. What's that letter, right there? Same letter here and here. What haven't you guessed?",Michael,Season 6,6x1
30886,"T! Yes! Yes! That is a 'T', and there's another one right there. Just sound that out. You're almost there.",Michael,Season 6,6x1
30887,"[opening blinds as Stanley walks past] Hey, Stanley! Where you goin', big guy? Up to no good?",Michael,Season 6,6x1
30889,"No, no, no, no. I just had a quick question for you. I'm casting a movie and I'm looking for a woman who can dance, beautiful woman. Do you know anybody?",Michael,Season 6,6x1
30891,Pays five million dollars. Nudity required.,Michael,Season 6,6x1
30892,[approaching Michael] You have to stop this.,Jim,Season 6,6x1
30893,"[giddy, whispering] Did you hear Stanley's having an affair?",Michael,Season 6,6x1
30894,I did. From you. You gotta stop telling people.,Jim,Season 6,6x1
30895,"Oh, okay, I get it. You feel out of the loop, and you feel sorry for yourself, and it's really sad because everybody thinks you're a loser...",Michael,Season 6,6x1
30896,Do you know if it's true? Do you have any idea? Because you might be ruining his life.,Jim,Season 6,6x1
30897,"[stares at Jim silently, then walks away]",Michael,Season 6,6x1
30898,"[in parking lot, blocking path of Stanley's car] Stop. Hold up, hold up, hold up! No, no, no. Time to stop being polite and get real. [Stanley honks horn repeatedly] Stanley, are you having an affair?",Michael,Season 6,6x1
30900,"So It's not true. Okay, well... ahhh, those interns, they told me they saw you at a club, and they all said it was you, it was clearly just... racial profiling gossip.",Michael,Season 6,6x1
30902,[nodding] So stupid!,Michael,Season 6,6x1
30904,"I know, I know.",Michael,Season 6,6x1
30906,"Oh, I bet.",Michael,Season 6,6x1
30908,"Wait, hold, hold, hold... so it IS true?",Michael,Season 6,6x1
30910,"Oh my God! Wait a second, do people often say they're going on sales calls and then go someplace else? 'Cause that's not cool.",Michael,Season 6,6x1
30912,[muttering] I'm not saying... a damn thing.,Michael,Season 6,6x1
30914,[looking afraid] You can count on me.,Michael,Season 6,6x1
30916,"[entering kitchen area] Oh, that smells good.",Michael,Season 6,6x1
30918,Did you hear about Angela? That's pretty weird.,Michael,Season 6,6x1
30920,"Well, the fact that she is apparently dating an 81-year-old billionaire. Owns a Quizno's on the turnpike.",Michael,Season 6,6x1
30922,Uh huh. [gestures to Kevin to keep it quiet] Alright?,Michael,Season 6,6x1
30923,"How do you un-tell something? You can't. You can't put words back in your mouth. What you can do is spread false gossip so that people think that everything that's been said is untrue, including 'Stanley is having an affair.' It's like the end of Spartacus. I've seen that movie half a dozen times, and I still don't know who the real Spartacus is, and that is what makes that movie a classic whodunit.",Michael,Season 6,6x1
30925,Yeah.,Michael,Season 6,6x1
30927,Anorexia. She's an anorexatic.,Michael,Season 6,6x1
30929,"Nothing can be done, we just have to tell everybody and hope for the best I guess.",Michael,Season 6,6x1
30930,"[to Kelly] I'm worried about Erin, because she's not a very good worker. I don't know how long she's gonna last here.",Michael,Season 6,6x1
30932,Yeah. So... and Andy is gay.,Michael,Season 6,6x1
30934,Mm hmm.,Michael,Season 6,6x1
30935,[whispering to Meredith] Did you hear Pam is pregnant?,Michael,Season 6,6x1
30937,Yeah!,Michael,Season 6,6x1
30968,"[whispering] Guys, guys... you can't believe everything you hear. Like Stanley, having an affair? That is crazy! It's just... there's no stalking it. It's a weird day for false facts. Let it go.",Michael,Season 6,6x1
30969,"[with everyone assembled in conference room] Okay everybody, big day. Last day for our interns, a lot of other stuff... who knows what to believe? Dwight, the honors.",Michael,Season 6,6x1
30970,"[giving envelopes to interns] Present these to the dean for credit. And, as a gift, I've attached my card. Call me any time of the day or night.",Dwight,Season 6,6x1
30972,"[grabs card from Eric, crumples it, throws it to the ground] Well now you can't call me at all. Problem solved.",Dwight,Season 6,6x1
30973,[to Eric] You're gonna regret that when you find yourself between a moose and her cubs.,Jim,Season 6,6x1
30974,"Look at the intern to your left. Now to your right. [interns do nothing] One of you will do exceedingly well in business, just unlimited potential. One of you will make a living, and nothing more. And one of you [looks directly at Megan] will make a great mother. It's up to you to choose which you want to be.",Dwight,Season 6,6x1
30978,"Oh, I don't really do that. But Pam might have some friends, though.",Jim,Season 6,6x1
30980,Yep.,Jim,Season 6,6x1
30982,Are you... interested in her guy friends?,Jim,Season 6,6x1
30984,Okay.,Jim,Season 6,6x1
30986,Really.,Jim,Season 6,6x1
30988,Well you gotta figure this out.,Jim,Season 6,6x1
30990,Yeah!,Jim,Season 6,6x1
30992,You gotta have sex with a woman.,Jim,Season 6,6x1
30994,And a man.,Jim,Season 6,6x1
30996,And then compare.,Jim,Season 6,6x1
30998,Yep.,Jim,Season 6,6x1
31000,On what?,Jim,Season 6,6x1
31002,[looks around room nervously],Jim,Season 6,6x1
31004,What?,Pam,Season 6,6x1
31006,Why did that come into your brain?,Pam,Season 6,6x1
31007,[grabs Pam by the arm] Can I talk to you for a second?,Jim,Season 6,6x1
31008,"[whispering to Pam in corner of room] So, they know.",Jim,Season 6,6x1
31009,Who did you tell?,Pam,Season 6,6x1
31010,I didn't tell anyone! Who did you tell?,Jim,Season 6,6x1
31011,Nobody!,Pam,Season 6,6x1
31016,"Hey, has everyone heard a crazy rumor about themselves today?",Jim,Season 6,6x1
31018,"[entering conference room] Yeah, yeah... you know what? Let's discredit these rumors.",Michael,Season 6,6x1
31019,"Yeah, sure, but... who's been saying all that stuff?",Jim,Season 6,6x1
31020,"That's not important, Jim, I just think we shouldn't listen to any of that crap.",Michael,Season 6,6x1
31021,"Sure, but we should get to the bottom of this. Let's pick a rumor and trace it back to the beginning.",Pam,Season 6,6x1
31026,[quietly leaves room],Michael,Season 6,6x1
31027,[approaching Michael at elevators] Michael? [to others] He's over here!,Pam,Season 6,6x1
31028,[to Michael] Where are you going?,Pam,Season 6,6x1
31029,Nowhere.,Michael,Season 6,6x1
31030,"Michael... [leads Michael to corner of vestibule, then whispers] You told people I use store-bought manure, when I showed you where my manure comes from. Hmm? Hmm? [Michael looks nervously to camera as elevator doors open]",Dwight,Season 6,6x1
31031,Don't get on it. [Michael inches toward elevator],Pam,Season 6,6x1
31032,"Michael, don't.",Jim,Season 6,6x1
31033,Don't... get... on. Do not.,Pam,Season 6,6x1
31034,Michael...,Jim,Season 6,6x1
31036,Step away.,Pam,Season 6,6x1
31038,[reluctantly exits elevator],Michael,Season 6,6x1
31039,"[to everyone, in conference room] Okay, I made it all up.",Michael,Season 6,6x1
31042,Yes.,Michael,Season 6,6x1
31044,"But guys, I'm a victim here too, okay? People here have been saying that I'm a J. Crew model.",Michael,Season 6,6x1
31046,"Jim? No, no. I spread the rumor that somebody here was a J. Crew model, and I was referring to myself.",Michael,Season 6,6x1
31048,"Because a lot of people think that models, even though they're very attractive, are somewhat vapid. It's set our industry back quite a bit.",Michael,Season 6,6x1
31051,"Okay, okay... here's the thing. There was one true rumor out there today. I didn't want everybody to know what it was. So all of you are off the hook, except for this one person.",Michael,Season 6,6x1
31055,"[sighs] The one true rumor, and this is going to ruin this person's life, is that...",Michael,Season 6,6x1
31056,[interrupting] That Pam's pregnant.,Jim,Season 6,6x1
31059,Okay. Thank you.,Jim,Season 6,6x1
31063,Who's the father?,Dwight,Season 6,6x1
31064,Jim.,Pam,Season 6,6x1
31066,Four months.,Jim,Season 6,6x1
31068,Stop. Don't. Just...,Pam,Season 6,6x1
31069,"Alright, alright... you know, this is not the truth, and you can't fall on the sword this way. The real thing is that Stanley Hudson had an affair.",Michael,Season 6,6x1
31070,Nope.,Jim,Season 6,6x1
31071,Yes. Jim...,Michael,Season 6,6x1
31072,"[arm around Pam] Thank you for trying to defend her. But actually, Pam is pregnant, and we can prove it.",Jim,Season 6,6x1
31073,Yes.,Pam,Season 6,6x1
31074,If everyone would like to see proof.,Jim,Season 6,6x1
31075,Okay. [leaves room],Pam,Season 6,6x1
31079,Look at that! [grabs sonogram from Pam] That is the inside of your vagina! [Jim takes sonogram from Michael],Michael,Season 6,6x1
31080,"[talking head with Jim] It's clear why we were trying not to tell people. That's clear now. [Jim nods, looking at floor]",Pam,Season 6,6x1
31081,[to Jim and Pam] How long have you known about the pregnancy?,Michael,Season 6,6x1
31083,A week? A month? A year?,Michael,Season 6,6x1
31084,"Michael, we only told our parents last week.",Jim,Season 6,6x1
31085,Did you pee on a stick?,Michael,Season 6,6x1
31086,I did. It was inconclusive.,Jim,Season 6,6x1
31087,You should've told me.,Michael,Season 6,6x1
31088,[exchanges looks with Jim] You're right. We should've realized that you are an equal part of this.,Pam,Season 6,6x1
31089,"[phone rings, hits speaker button]",Michael,Season 6,6x1
31091,[gasps],Michael,Season 6,6x1
31092,[in disbelief] You called Stanley's wife?,Pam,Season 6,6x1
31093,"Oh, oh... yeah, a long time ago, just to make sure she was out of town. Oh... oh God.",Michael,Season 6,6x1
31094,Don't take it.,Jim,Season 6,6x1
31095,"No, I have to take it, or it'll seem suspicious.",Michael,Season 6,6x1
31096,"If you talk to her, you're gonna tell her about Stanley, and that's gonna seem more suspicious.",Pam,Season 6,6x1
31097,"No, no, I can do this.",Michael,Season 6,6x1
31098,You can't do this.,Jim,Season 6,6x1
31099,"Yes, I can. I am going to tell her that I need to redecorate my condo, and I need her help. We will haggle about money, and then I will back down, and then I won't talk to her until this whole Cynthia thing has blown over.",Michael,Season 6,6x1
31100,That sounds terrible.,Jim,Season 6,6x1
31101,"Michael, please don't.",Pam,Season 6,6x1
31102,"[picking up phone] Hey, what up, Cynthia? [lowers phone, looking terrified]",Michael,Season 6,6x1
31103,"[gets up to leave room, Michael gestures for him to stay]",Jim,Season 6,6x1
31104,"Hold on a second, Cynthia.",Michael,Season 6,6x1
31105,"[hangs up Michael's phone, leaves room]",Jim,Season 6,6x1
31106,"Well, it turns out that Teri was already suspicious, because she had caught Stanley and Cynthia a few months ago. So Stanley promised that he would stop, and he did, end of story. Well, not exactly. [camera pans down from Michael's office window to parking lot below, Stanley is seen destroying Michael's Sebring with a crowbar] Uhh, Cynthia kept calling him, she would not stop calling him, and she was in love with him. Oh, and get this. Cynthia, also married. So... you can't stop love, I guess [Jim is seen displaying fetus picture on his desk as Pam smiles] and quite frankly, I don't think you should ever try.",Michael,Season 6,6x1
31115,[knock at Michael's Office door] Yeah?,Michael,Season 6,6x2
31117,"Yes, Oscar come on in.  Close the door if you would.  Thank you, thanks so much for talking to me.",Michael,Season 6,6x2

31123,It is a colonoscopy.,Michael,Season 6,6x2
31125,"In your experience, what should I be expecting in terms of sensation or emotions? [Oscar looks irritated and frustrated] Is there anything I can do to make it more pleasurable for me or for Dr. Shaundry?",Michael,Season 6,6x2
31127,"My main concern, should I have a safe word?",Michael,Season 6,6x2
31130,"Abso... you know what? I'll do you one better, Sunday, Sunday night.",Michael,Season 6,6x2
31132,"Ho, Hol, hold on big guy, I'm gonna put it in the mail Sunday night and you'll get it Weds.",Michael,Season 6,6x2
31134,Sure.,Jim,Season 6,6x2
31135,"Hey, Good luck.",Pam,Season 6,6x2
31136,"Oh right, this thing. I remember now.  [whispers to Jim]  What's this about?",Michael,Season 6,6x2
31137,"Ah, this is just me and David, if that's okay.",Jim,Season 6,6x2
31138,It's okay with me but he's gonna want me in there.,Michael,Season 6,6x2
31140,Really?,Michael,Season 6,6x2
31142,"Alright, do you mind if it sit this out?  I have so much work to do, I feel like I'm gonna blow my brains out.",Michael,Season 6,6x2
31144,"Am I worried that Jim and David are having a meeting without me?  No, because we are the Three Amigos.  And once in awhile one of the Amigos will go off... to the bathroom... while the other two have a secret meeting.  [shrugs]",Michael,Season 6,6x2
31145,Hey let me escort you to your desk.,Michael,Season 6,6x2
31146,"Okay, it's just three or four steps but thank you, thank you.",Pam,Season 6,6x2

31150,"Ummm, I don't know.",Pam,Season 6,6x2
31151,"Well, you said good luck to Jim as he walked in.",Michael,Season 6,6x2
31152,"Did I?  Doesn't sound like me, not very superstitious.",Pam,Season 6,6x2
31153,"If you are lying to me right now Pam, your baby is gonna come out a liar.  That's how it works.  They inherit things through the breast milk.",Michael,Season 6,6x2
31154,Please don't talk about my breast milk.,Pam,Season 6,6x2
31155,I just don't want you to lie to me.  I don't want you to ever lie to me.  Have I ever lied to you?,Michael,Season 6,6x2
31156,Yeah.,Pam,Season 6,6x2
31157,I just don't want you to.,Michael,Season 6,6x2
31161,"Hmmm, interesting.  How did the ladder end up on top of you, if you fell off of it?",Dwight,Season 6,6x2
31163,"Oh really, I'm sorry I thought this was a free country.  I didn't know we were in communist Sweden.",Dwight,Season 6,6x2
31165,"Nnnnn, that's not... okay.",Dwight,Season 6,6x2

31170,"So long Darryl, feel better... [to Toby] He's lying.",Dwight,Season 6,6x2
31172,"Oh? From who, Dr. J?  Look, you really need to investigate this.  People don't just fall off of ladders.",Dwight,Season 6,6x2
31174,Since when have you known Darryl to rush to do anything other than to come up here for birthday cake?  [imitating Darryl]  Y'all having birthday cake?,Dwight,Season 6,6x2
31176,Please... and how many foremen do you know that pull boxes?,Dwight,Season 6,6x2
31178,It just doesn't add up.,Dwight,Season 6,6x2
31180,"[walks into conference room on his cell phone, interrupting David and Jim] Uh huh, well if he doesn't like it you can tell that SOB that he is fired.  Sorry, I'm going into a meeting right now.  I will... I love you too.  Bye.",Michael,Season 6,6x2
31181,Who was that?,Jim,Season 6,6x2

31192,"What is Jim telling him?  That I can't handle this job?  That 's bull crap.  That is bull crap.  Although, it has been chaotic lately.  Corporate shut down the Buffalo branch which left us to absorb all of their clients.  I will tell you there has been work everyday.  Had to come in on a Saturday. To retrieve... I left my cell phone here.",Michael,Season 6,6x2

31197,"I don't know, he hasn't RSVP'd yet.",Pam,Season 6,6x2
31198,"We invited everyone in the office to our wedding.  Even though we realized most people wouldn't be able to make the drive to Niagara Falls.  [whispers] Which is why we're having it in Niagara Falls.  [normal volume] Then Michael told everyone they could have Friday and Monday  off, if they came.  So now, people have to decide if they want to come to our wedding or have to work.",Pam,Season 6,6x2
31201,[staring into the conference room] How are your sales doin'?,Michael,Season 6,6x2

31206,Wallace had to show up on the one four month period that I'm completely overwhelmed.,Michael,Season 6,6x2
31207,"You know when they say it's so crazy it just might work?  Well, I don't believe that.  I say go for the air-tight plan and that is why I am having Andy wheel me into the conference room inside a makeshift cheese cart.  It is just elegant.",Michael,Season 6,6x2
31208,[in the cheese cart] Be my eyes.,Michael,Season 6,6x2
31217,"No, I won't.   Alright, thanks for giving me your time,  I appreciate it.",Jim,Season 6,6x2

31257,Look who you're talking to.,Michael,Season 6,6x2
31259,"Well I would say that my greatest talent is being the best man, woman, or child, to have ever run this branch, ever.",Michael,Season 6,6x2
31261,[looks at Jim]   Permission to speak on the record?,Michael,Season 6,6x2
31263,"Jim is like Big Bird.  He is tall and yellow and very nice.  But would I put him in charge?  No, I don't think so.  Because Big Bird doesn't make the tough decisions.  I... If I was gonna put someone in charge, I would put Burt in charge or I would put one of the real grown-ups in charge, like Maria or Gordon, maybe.",Michael,Season 6,6x2
31265,"Very much, Jim is my best friend. But it's his performance report... right here.  Now this was written by Toby, who we all know is extremely reliable.",Michael,Season 6,6x2
31267,"It's not very well written, but you get the gist.",Michael,Season 6,6x2
31269,I can just continue to run it myself.,Michael,Season 6,6x2
31271,This was Jim's idea?,Michael,Season 6,6x2
31273,"Wow.  Ummm, well I'd have to talk to my mother and my guy at H and R Block.",Michael,Season 6,6x2
31275,"I didn't tell Michael because I thought he'd try to help.  Example, he handed out Jello shots at the 23rd mile of the Steamtown marathon.",Jim,Season 6,6x2
31277,Sure.,Jim,Season 6,6x2
31278,"[after talking to David, Jim looks dejected] I can't help but feel partially responsible.",Michael,Season 6,6x2
31279,[shakes jelly beans] Little pick me up?  [Jim accepts] Oh those are the best.  Little sugar rush.,Michael,Season 6,6x2
31280,"When you were in the office earlier talking to Wallace, did I come up at all?",Jim,Season 6,6x2
31281,Well we did talk about how handsome you are.,Michael,Season 6,6x2
31282,Why don't we head in your office to talk?,Jim,Season 6,6x2
31283,"Oh what a week, God.  We said... I know there were certain things we said...",Michael,Season 6,6x2
31284,"Michael, look I'll just be honest with you.  Earlier today I spoke with Wallace about a promotion.  I actually think that talk went really well.  And then after he spoke with you, for some reason it felt like things had changed.",Jim,Season 6,6x2
31285,"Hmmm, that's weird, that's weird... it's kinda weirding me out.  Did you know that Lincoln's secretary was named Kennedy.",Michael,Season 6,6x2
31286,"Michael, did you say anything?",Jim,Season 6,6x2
31287,"Tell you what, when you leave this office I am going to call Wallace and I am going to tell him that you should get that promotion.",Michael,Season 6,6x2
31288,Really?,Jim,Season 6,6x2
31289,Yes!,Michael,Season 6,6x2
31290,You will?  Wanna do it right now?,Jim,Season 6,6x2
31291,Yes.,Michael,Season 6,6x2
31292,I tried to keep Michael in the dark.  I should have known that he can do just as much damage in the dark.,Jim,Season 6,6x2
31293,I need to see your pupils.   I need to see if they're dilated.,Dwight,Season 6,6x2
31298,We thought that she was you.,Dwight,Season 6,6x2
31300,Are you... are you serious?  Be... cause you look exactly alike.  Am I the only one?  Are you getting this?,Dwight,Season 6,6x2
31303,"Aww, Darryl.",Dwight,Season 6,6x2
31307,"Hey David, this is Michael Scott.  [Jim pushes speaker phone button]  Michael Scott here.",Michael,Season 6,6x2
31309,Just wanted to talk to you about  Jim Halpert.  I understand that he did not receive the promotion.  And I wanted to see what I could do to nudge you in the right direction.,Michael,Season 6,6x2
31313,"Wha... here's the thing, Jim is the best man for this job, I think you should give it to him.",Michael,Season 6,6x2
31315,"Well, nnnn, that... that was an anomaly.  That file had been falsified.  Toby Flenderson is doing drugs.",Michael,Season 6,6x2
31319,Wait!  They're using the lift as their own personal elevator.,Dwight,Season 6,6x2
31321,"He broke his ankle climbing over the railing and he lied about it because it was a misuse of company equipment, case closed.",Dwight,Season 6,6x2
31323,Really?  Then why is there new wood only on one railing?  Hmmm?   We should check the security tapes Toby.,Dwight,Season 6,6x2
31326,Yes!,Dwight,Season 6,6x2
31328,"Now, I would like to file an official complaint to corporate because Darryl lied on an official form.",Dwight,Season 6,6x2
31330,Phhhht.  No judge is gonna believe that...,Dwight,Season 6,6x2
31333,"Hey, hey Jim, it would make me feel really good right now if you would just punch me in the face.  Alright,  Just do it.",Michael,Season 6,6x2
31334,How many times have I asked you to put me up for a branch manager job.,Jim,Season 6,6x2
31335,"I never recommended you because I didn't want to lose you and I didn't want to lose Pam, [starts to choke up] and now I don't wanna lose the baby.",Michael,Season 6,6x2
31336,"So instead, you screwed me?",Jim,Season 6,6x2
31337,That's what she...,Michael,Season 6,6x2
31338,No.,Jim,Season 6,6x2
31340,Kind of in the middle of something here.,Michael,Season 6,6x2
31342,"I, yeah... no, I'll tell him myself.  Let's both.",Michael,Season 6,6x2
31343,[on phone] Hello.,Michael,Season 6,6x2
31345,"No, it's just us.",Michael,Season 6,6x2
31347,"Oh, oh, well here he is right now.  [Michael knocks on desk]  Come in.  [Makes sound effects for door opening and footsteps and points to Jim to answer]",Michael,Season 6,6x2
31348,Hi David.,Jim,Season 6,6x2
31350,Well just as long as it means Jim becomes a manager.,Michael,Season 6,6x2
31352,"Wow, that sounds pretty cool.",Jim,Season 6,6x2
31353,"I like that, so manager and co-manager.",Michael,Season 6,6x2
31355,Well that might be a little confusing for people because they know me as manager.,Michael,Season 6,6x2
31357,"Okay people,  listen up, I have an announcement to make, fraud was committed...",Dwight,Season 6,6x2
31358,"Okay everybody, I have an announcement to make... whoa do you have an announcement?",Michael,Season 6,6x2
31359,I'm... I was making it.,Dwight,Season 6,6x2
31360,"Everybody, David Wallace and I have talked and we have decided to promote Jim to the position of co-manager.",Michael,Season 6,6x2
31362,"Of your butt, and your butt, and your butt, all of the Scranton branch butts.",Michael,Season 6,6x2
31364,"What's happening to me?  I am also being promoted to co-manager, we will be co-managers together.  Jim Halpert, welcome.",Michael,Season 6,6x2
31365,[shakes Michael's hand] Thank you. [Dwight looks disappointed and angry behind them],Jim,Season 6,6x2
31366,AHHHHHHHHHHHH!,Dwight,Season 6,6x2
31368,Do you think that you could send in your RSVP card?,Pam,Season 6,6x2
31370,"Well, you have to choose a food option and there's information in there about directions and lodging...",Pam,Season 6,6x2
31372,"You are going to text me, the morning of my wedding.",Pam,Season 6,6x2
31374,To ask for directions..,Pam,Season 6,6x2
31376,And you will eat whatever is fanciest?,Pam,Season 6,6x2
31379,"So rude, right?",Pam,Season 6,6x2
31381,"[sits down] Oh my gosh, I have been chasing people down all day.  It's incredible.",Pam,Season 6,6x2
31383,[in Michael's office] Could you please sign my expense report?,Dwight,Season 6,6x3
31384,"No way, no how. Expense reports are a day-to-day item. That is Jim's now. I am exclusively big picture, epic.",Michael,Season 6,6x3
31385,[in Jim's office]  Sign this.,Dwight,Season 6,6x3
31386,"Ah, ah, ah. Where's the 'please'? We're not animals.",Jim,Season 6,6x3
31387,Sign it.,Dwight,Season 6,6x3
31388,"No, not without a 'please.'",Jim,Season 6,6x3
31389,Idiot.,Dwight,Season 6,6x3
31390,[in Michael's office] I have a complaint about Jim.,Dwight,Season 6,6x3
31391,That is not big picture.,Michael,Season 6,6x3
31392,"I would like to file a huge, enormous, massive complaint about the tallest guy in our office.",Dwight,Season 6,6x3
31393,... Okay.,Michael,Season 6,6x3
31394,Jim won't sign my expense report.,Dwight,Season 6,6x3
31395,That is not-- okay-- that is day-to-day.,Michael,Season 6,6x3
31396,"No, that is huge.",Dwight,Season 6,6x3
31397,You're trying to trick me.,Michael,Season 6,6x3
31398,This has to do--,Dwight,Season 6,6x3
31399,"Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.",Michael,Season 6,6x3
31400,[in Jim's office] I'd like to lodge a complaint.,Dwight,Season 6,6x3
31401,I'm sorry to hear about that. Who is this about?,Jim,Season 6,6x3
31402,You!,Dwight,Season 6,6x3
31403,Okay. Just want to let you know I take complaints very seriously. So... When did this happen?,Jim,Season 6,6x3
31404,One minute ago.,Dwight,Season 6,6x3
31405,Okay. And how do you feel?,Jim,Season 6,6x3
31406,Angry.,Dwight,Season 6,6x3
31407,All right. Did he hit you?,Jim,Season 6,6x3
31408,No.,Dwight,Season 6,6x3
31409,Did you cry?,Jim,Season 6,6x3
31410,No.,Dwight,Season 6,6x3
31411,Did you feel like crying?,Jim,Season 6,6x3
31412,No.,Dwight,Season 6,6x3
31413,I'm just gonna write 'held back tears.',Jim,Season 6,6x3
31414,"Wait, stop writing that. That is not true.",Dwight,Season 6,6x3
31415,"If you stop crying, I'll stop writing it.",Jim,Season 6,6x3
31416,I'm not cr-- uhh!,Dwight,Season 6,6x3
31417,"I deserved that promotion, not Jim. Oh, man. Makes me want to put him in a triangle choke hold and force him down to the ground and just keep pressing and pressing. And then flip him over and then put him in a hammer lock! And he's gasping, he's panting! Every last breath! And the crowd is going crazy. And boom! I emerge victorious! [claps hands and stands up] Aha! $18,000 and a chance at the title! Ooh hah!",Dwight,Season 6,6x3
31419,"Everyone, now would be a good time to freshen up, because I'd like everyone to meet in the conference room in five minutes. And I suggest that you bring a snack, because we may be in there for a while.",Michael,Season 6,6x3
31420,Michael...,Jim,Season 6,6x3
31421,Yes?,Michael,Season 6,6x3
31422,Can I talk to you in my office for a second?,Jim,Season 6,6x3
31423,"Mmm, sure, but could I first talk to you in my office?",Michael,Season 6,6x3
31426,I have noticed that we--,Jim,Season 6,6x3
31427,Welcome.,Michael,Season 6,6x3
31428,Thank you. I've noticed we've been having a lot of conference room meetings.,Jim,Season 6,6x3
31429,Mm-hmm.,Michael,Season 6,6x3
31430,"And I'm wondEring if perhaps those are a bit, um--",Jim,Season 6,6x3
31431,Disruptive.,Michael,Season 6,6x3
31432,Yes.,Jim,Season 6,6x3
31433,"No, I don't think they are. I think the meetings are very important.",Michael,Season 6,6x3
31434,"Okay, maybe we should talk specifics.",Jim,Season 6,6x3
31435,Let's do.,Michael,Season 6,6x3
31436,"Okay. Yesterday, we had a meeting about planets.",Jim,Season 6,6x3
31437,"N-- well, to be fair, Jim... James... Jimothy... To be fair, Jimothy, the-- ah, that sounds weird. Are you okay with being called Jim?",Michael,Season 6,6x3
31438,I am.,Jim,Season 6,6x3
31439,"Alright. Jim, to be fair, the conversation wasn't about planets...",Michael,Season 6,6x3
31440,Right.,Jim,Season 6,6x3
31441,"At first, we were talking about introducing a line of toilet paper. And what part of the human body does one use toilet paper upon? So you draw a line from there to the other planets, and I think by the end, we all learned a little bit about how small we are.",Michael,Season 6,6x3
31442,"Yes, I agree.",Jim,Season 6,6x3
31443,"Because it's a big universe, and we're all just little, tiny specks of dust.",Michael,Season 6,6x3
31444,I just think that maybe they're eating large amounts of the day.,Jim,Season 6,6x3
31445,"You know what eats a large amount of the day are naps. You go to sleep, it's light out, you wake up, it's dark. That's the whole day. Where did that day go? I have no idea.",Michael,Season 6,6x3
31446,You mean on a weekend?,Jim,Season 6,6x3
31447,Yes.,Michael,Season 6,6x3
31448,How about this? I think our goal should be we don't have meetings unless they're absolutely essential.,Jim,Season 6,6x3
31449,Alright. No more meetings this week.,Michael,Season 6,6x3
31450,Really? You just agreed to that?,Jim,Season 6,6x3
31451,I can be very suprising.,Michael,Season 6,6x3
31453,"I need to fit into my wedding dress. However, I'm also pregnant.",Pam,Season 6,6x3
31456,"We did, but mostly because people expect us to. We're also accepting other gifts not on the registry... However much.",Pam,Season 6,6x3
31457,"It's awkward asking people for money, but we could really use it. Why doesn't Crate & Barrel let you register for a toaster full of cash?",Pam,Season 6,6x3
31459,"Oh, good.",Pam,Season 6,6x3
31461,"No, we're not.",Pam,Season 6,6x3
31463,Mm-hmm?,Michael,Season 6,6x3
31464,"[walks in, see's Oscar, Stanley, Creed and Kelly sitting in Michaels office] Okay, I thought I saw people missing.",Jim,Season 6,6x3
31465,"Yeah, just focus-grouping a product expansion idea to these folks. Got one of each.",Michael,Season 6,6x3
31466,"Really? Hey, Stanley, what was the last thing Michael said before I came through the door?",Jim,Season 6,6x3
31467,"Stanley, you don't need to answer that.",Michael,Season 6,6x3
31468,Stanley?,Jim,Season 6,6x3
31470,"Okay, Michael, I thought we agreed to not take up people's time with meetings like these.",Jim,Season 6,6x3
31471,What do you mean by 'these people'?,Michael,Season 6,6x3
31472,"Michael, this is a conference room meeting.",Jim,Season 6,6x3
31473,"Oh, hey, everybody, I think that Jim has gone insane, because he thinks that my office is a conference room.",Michael,Season 6,6x3
31474,That's not what I meant.,Jim,Season 6,6x3
31475,"Listen, Jim, no offense, but when push comes to shove, what I want is more important that what you want.",Michael,Season 6,6x3
31476,I disagree.,Jim,Season 6,6x3
31477,What do you guys think? [all start talking at the same time],Michael,Season 6,6x3
31478,"Great. Guys, can I just have a moment alone with Michael?",Jim,Season 6,6x3
31479,"No, no, no, you don't need to go anywhere. Anything that Jim has to say to me, he can say in front of these types of people.",Michael,Season 6,6x3
31480,"That is not what I said, and, also, I am co-manager, meaning you are not the only manager anymore. I am also I co-manager.",Jim,Season 6,6x3
31481,That is not what Wallace told us.,Michael,Season 6,6x3
31482,That's exactly what Wallace told us.,Jim,Season 6,6x3
31483,That is not the way I heard it.,Michael,Season 6,6x3
31485,"It is one thing, me giving you the co-manager title. It is another thing, you bossing me around.",Michael,Season 6,6x3
31486,"I'm not bossing you around. I'm trying to do my job, which is sharing your job, so maybe we should just call David Wallace.",Jim,Season 6,6x3
31487,"No, no, no. No, we will not call David Wallace. [Michael pulls out his cell phone] I will call David Wallace.",Michael,Season 6,6x3
31489,Or David Wallace will call us on line two. Why don't we just--,Michael,Season 6,6x3
31490,"Hey, David. You got Jim here.",Jim,Season 6,6x3
31491,"Hey David, this is Michael, senior co-manager.",Michael,Season 6,6x3
31493,"Got it, Dave. Sounds like your classice big-picture decision.",Michael,Season 6,6x3
31494,Which will clearly affect the day-to-day well-being of our employees.,Jim,Season 6,6x3
31496,Which is it more of?,Michael,Season 6,6x3
31498,"David, I know that I'm very new at this, but I have a very good perspective on how things work.",Jim,Season 6,6x3
31500,I thought maybe we could talk after this is over.,Michael,Season 6,6x3
31502,"Nope, not at all.",Jim,Season 6,6x3
31503,"No, it will not be. I am on top of it.",Michael,Season 6,6x3
31505,"Alright, thanks alot, David.",Jim,Season 6,6x3
31506,"Talk to you later-- [Jim hangs up] Okay, you didn't let me say good-bye. [sighs, and claps hands once] Alright, I am looking forward to this.",Michael,Season 6,6x3
31507,You don't have to lie.,Jim,Season 6,6x3
31508,"I hate the fact that we have to do this together. I think we work better separately. When I am irritated and I look at you, I don't see you anymore.",Michael,Season 6,6x3
31509,Right.,Jim,Season 6,6x3
31510,All I can see is how big and gross the pores on your nose are.,Michael,Season 6,6x3
31511,Alright. Let's get started.,Jim,Season 6,6x3
31514,"You know, there's no easy way to do this. I say we add 1.5% to their paychecks and don't say anything about it.",Michael,Season 6,6x3
31515,"Do you mean, like break-in in the middle of the night and change the numbers on payroll?",Jim,Season 6,6x3
31516,"No, we can do it during the day. It doesn't have to be that dramatic, Jim.",Michael,Season 6,6x3
31517,Okay. You know what would help is a pros and cons list for our options.,Jim,Season 6,6x3
31518,"Jim, don't take this the wrong way. Are you gonna take this the wrong way?",Michael,Season 6,6x3
31519,It's hard to tell so far.,Jim,Season 6,6x3
31520,You use your brain too much.,Michael,Season 6,6x3
31521,"I'm sorry, are you advocating that I use it less?",Jim,Season 6,6x3
31522,Sometimes the smartest people don't think at all.,Michael,Season 6,6x3
31523,You just came up with that.,Jim,Season 6,6x3
31524,As I was saying it.,Michael,Season 6,6x3
31525,"Yeah. Okay, so for the 1.5% increase, pro-- everyone gets a little bit.",Jim,Season 6,6x3
31526,[in nerdy voice] Con-- you look like a nerd.,Michael,Season 6,6x3
31527,Con-- no one gets as much as they did last year.,Jim,Season 6,6x3
31528,Pro-- you get to share your pros and cons list with the other nerds.,Michael,Season 6,6x3
31529,Pro-- no favoritism.,Jim,Season 6,6x3
31530,"Con-- you unzip your pants, and you find that there's a calculator down there.",Michael,Season 6,6x3
31531,"I've been studying Michael for years, and I've condensed what I've learned into this chart-- [pulls out a pie chart] How Michael spends his time. As you can see, we have procrastinating and distracting others, and this tiny sliver here is critical thinking. I made it bigger, so that you could see it.",Jim,Season 6,6x3
31533,I don't think we registered anywhere. We just want cash.,Pam,Season 6,6x3
31535,Mm-hmm.,Pam,Season 6,6x3
31537,Yeah.,Pam,Season 6,6x3
31539,Okay.,Pam,Season 6,6x3
31541,Is this what I've become? Materialistic? Shallow? I feel horrible. [looks down at the check] oh look! 'Mrs. Pam Halpert!' That's the first time I've seen it in writing!,Pam,Season 6,6x3
31542,"You know, the more I think about it, the more I think we should give it to the salesmen.",Jim,Season 6,6x3
31543,That will not go over well.,Michael,Season 6,6x3
31544,"I know. I just think it seems smart to keep the salesmen happy right now. 'Course I know that this might come off as biased, so you know what? Let us...",Jim,Season 6,6x3
31545,"Oh, my God! Are you gonna make another pro and con list? I'm gonna kill myself.",Michael,Season 6,6x3
31546,I'm not gonna let you stop me from thinking.,Jim,Season 6,6x3
31547,"No! I could not do that, Jim. I can see it in your crusty little eyes that you are going to make everything perfect. If I can just think this through, if I could just think it exactly right, I can make this perfect, and then I can go down every avenue, and every avenue off of that avenue, and then another avenue.",Michael,Season 6,6x3
31548,Michael.,Jim,Season 6,6x3
31549,And then another--,Michael,Season 6,6x3
31550,"Look, you have a lot of strengths.",Jim,Season 6,6x3
31551,"Oh, I do?! Tell me what they are.",Michael,Season 6,6x3
31552,I think that you are able to take constructive criticism very well.,Jim,Season 6,6x3
31553,Ha! That-- I am not known for that!,Michael,Season 6,6x3
31554,But there is a reason why I'm here!,Jim,Season 6,6x3
31555,Yes! You went over my head to Wallace!,Michael,Season 6,6x3
31556,"No, it's because you also have a lot of weaknesses, Michael!",Jim,Season 6,6x3
31557,"Okay. Well, why don't you tell me what those are, Jim? Why don't you enliven me?",Michael,Season 6,6x3
31558,I don't think you're good at making tough decisions!,Jim,Season 6,6x3
31559,Ah.,Michael,Season 6,6x3
31560,"At thinking out the options, and then stating that decision very clearly, especially when it's an unpopular decision.",Jim,Season 6,6x3
31561,"Okay, here's a tough decision for you. You suck! You suck! Is that clear enough for you?!",Michael,Season 6,6x3
31562,"But maybe I'm here for a reason, because I might have some good ideas, too. I've been sitting out there, and I've been learning a lot, and maybe I can just bring something different to the table.",Jim,Season 6,6x3
31563,"Okay, Skippy, here we go. Why don't you run yourself out there and tell them? [laughs] You call it.",Michael,Season 6,6x3
31564,[leave the conference room to address everyone],Jim,Season 6,6x3
31565,[to the camera] This had better be terrible.,Michael,Season 6,6x3
31566,"Could I have everyone's attention, please? I have some tough news, so I'm just gonna give it to you straight. Truth is, we only have so much money for raises this year, so the simple fact is some people will get raises, and some people won't. Now, what we've decided is, we are gonna give those raises to the sales staff.",Jim,Season 6,6x3
31568,"Look, you guys are smart, so I'm just leveling with you. I'm just trying to treat you like adults.",Jim,Season 6,6x3
31572,"Ooh, easy. That's not it at all.",Jim,Season 6,6x3
31574,"Really what it is, is about the money the sales staff brings into the office.",Jim,Season 6,6x3

31593,"That was good! That was good! Okay, all right. Well, we all know it's hard to be a boss, right? You know what? Look around you. These are your best friends. These are the people who will open their hearts to you. They all have heart-ons for you [someone growns in disgust], and that is a gift. So in terms of gifts, we should be giving each other gifts. Angela, yes, lend Oscar a cup of sugar. This--",Michael,Season 6,6x3

31624,"Okay, your move.",Jim,Season 6,6x3
31625,Alright! Who to pick? [walking around the table] Who to pick?,Michael,Season 6,6x3

31629,I need more time.,Michael,Season 6,6x3
31631,"People are starting to notice how terrible Jim is. It's great. Eventually, they'll rise up and revolt. My only hope is that they do it sooner rather than later.

31687,We would really appreciate it.,Jim,Season 6,6x4
31688,Pam is constantly throwing up because of the pregnancy. If she eats something the fetus doesn't like she is screwed. It's amazing. A three ounce fetus is calling the shots. It's so bad ass.,Dwight,Season 6,6x4

31816,"Oh no. Now that I don't have a room, can I stay with you?",Dwight,Season 6,6x4

Just going to do a little free standing comedy and if at the end everybody wants to raise their glasses to Pam and Jim, then so be it. Hey, what is the deal with the Smart Car? How smart is that? Those things are tiny. Can you even drive them in traffic? 'I'm so smart. E=mc... squared. I drive a Smart Car.' That's not smart in my book. The real smart car is Kitt from Knight Rider.",Michael,Season 6,6x4

31922,"Aw, thanks, Pete. That was really nice. I just want to say how happy we are that all of you are here tonight. And I want to especially thank those of you who traveled from far away to be here with us tonight... especially the Flordia cousins who, obviously, can't take a hint. [laughter] Four years ago, I was just a guy who had a crush on a girl who had a boyfriend. And I had to do the hardest thing that I've ever had to do... which was just to wait. Uh, don't get me wrong. I flirted with her. Pam, I can now admit in front of my friends and family that I do know how to make a photo copy. Didn't need your help that many times. And do you remember how long it took you to teach me how to drive a stick?",Jim,Season 6,6x4
31923,Like... a year.,Pam,Season 6,6x4
31924,"I've been driving stick since high school. So... yes. For a really long time that's all I had. I just had little moments with a girl who saw me as friend. And a lot of people told me I was crazy to wait this long for a date with a girl who I worked with, but I think even then I knew that... I was waiting for my wife. So...  I would like to propose a toast. So if you'd all raise your glasses. Not Pam, for obvious reasons, but everyone else. If you would raise your glasses--",Jim,Season 6,6x4
31926,"Pam can't drink? I didn't-- I shouldn't have said that. I don't know why I did. She can do whatever she wants, though she shouldn't. She shouldn't because she's an alcoholic. Pam is an alcoholic. That's not true. I-- no. What we want-- the real reason is that, that Pam's pregnant.",Jim,Season 6,6x4
31927,"[clears throat] Ok. Ok. Hey. What I think Jim is trying to say is that... they had an accident and you know what? These two people, they're living together, they're having lots of consentual sex--",Michael,Season 6,6x4
31929,"Yes. Yes they were living together. Yes and you know what? You can't expect them to be careful every time. Because, frankly, it's just a different sensation.",Michael,Season 6,6x4
31930,Michael.,Jim,Season 6,6x4
31931,"When you c-- well? Am I wrong? They say it's not different, but it's a different sensation.",Michael,Season 6,6x4

31964,"Oh. Isn't he terrible? May I? Here's the thing. Umm... Mema, I think you just need to chill out about this whole Pam getting pregnant thing. It's not 1890 anymore. It's modern day. And women have sex before marriage and I think we need to celebrate that. And I know in your day she would be considered a whore but, now, women go out and they have sex and they get wild and they take their tops off and they have pictures taken of them and we need to encouage them. That's part of life.",Michael,Season 6,6x4

31992,"Looks like you're going to a fish fry, Dwight.",Michael,Season 6,6x4

32168,So beautiful. [Pam's starts to cry.  Jim pulls up chair to sit next to her] Hey--,Jim,Season 6,6x4

32482,Okay.,Michael,Season 6,6x5
32483,"I don't understand, why would you buy a policy?",Dwight,Season 6,6x5
32484,It's just the cost of a cup of coffee an hour.,Michael,Season 6,6x5
32486,I had to make a snap decision Dwight.,Michael,Season 6,6x5
32487,"It wasn't a snap decision, you were sitting there for an hour.",Dwight,Season 6,6x5

32497,"How did you get this number? Michael, we're on a catamaran.",Jim,Season 6,6x5
32498,"It wasn't easy. I had to tell the hotel it was a medical emergency. I chose massive coronary, cause you told me that your Dad had a bad heart. Listen man, I, I got a problem, I think I'm in trouble with the mob. Or a major insurance carrier.",Michael,Season 6,6x5
32499,That sounds bad.,Jim,Season 6,6x5
32500,"Yeah, I know and you usually can get out of stuff like this, so I'm turning to you my friend.",Michael,Season 6,6x5
32501,I'm gonna help you through it all right?,Jim,Season 6,6x5

32509,A- ah--,Jim,Season 6,6x5

32514,Jim?!? [dial tone] Oh my God.,Michael,Season 6,6x5
32515,"Hey uh, question for you. I recently purchased some insurance that I can't afford given my present salary. Is there anything accounting-wise I can do to sort of make it all go away?",Michael,Season 6,6x5
32517,Oh no. Um. What about this Cash For Clunkers thing?,Michael,Season 6,6x5
32519,"All right. Well, it was a thought. Thanks.",Michael,Season 6,6x5
32520,"We have let Michael down, and it's 85 percent your fault.",Dwight,Season 6,6x5
32522,"Not on the inside he's not. Look at his life! Broke! Living in fear! No friends, dead end job.",Dwight,Season 6,6x5
32524,"Not the living in fear, that's new.",Dwight,Season 6,6x5
32526,Yes. He's got to stand up to this mafia guy.,Dwight,Season 6,6x5
32528,Me neither. Not the way things are now. But what if Michael felt no fear toward the mafia guy?,Dwight,Season 6,6x5
32530,Yeah...,Dwight,Season 6,6x5
32532,What is wrong with you? I am talking about convincing Michael that the guy's not mafia!,Dwight,Season 6,6x5
32534,Well more far-fetched than a mobster walking into a paper company for a low-level shakedown?  And that happened.,Dwight,Season 6,6x5
32535,Michael. Incredible news. Grotti is clean.,Dwight,Season 6,6x5
32536,No. He's not. He's just good. Nothing sticks to him. You still don't understand how this works.,Michael,Season 6,6x5
32538,"It's true, he's clean. I have a couple of friends still on the force. Checked with them. Ran his Fed friend up the flagpole to make sure he wasn't on the take. Turns out he's a totally lovely guy. Sweetest guy on the force really.",Dwight,Season 6,6x5
32540,But Grotti acts like he's mafia though.,Michael,Season 6,6x5
32542,And he made us all look like chumps!,Dwight,Season 6,6x5
32543,[grunts],Michael,Season 6,6x5
32544,"If there is one thing I hate more than the mafia it is a liar. I wish the mafia would go out and kill all the liars. Bury them in my yard. And I wouldn't tell the cops a thing. Not that I would be lying per se. But I would just get really quiet, all of a sudden.",Michael,Season 6,6x5
32546,This is Scott.,Michael,Season 6,6x5
32548,Oh really? Is that supposed to scare me?,Michael,Season 6,6x5
32550,Well you thought wrong. Because I am not pleased. I'm actually kind of PO'd.,Michael,Season 6,6x5
32552,"I think you know exactly why, because you were trying to scare me into buying insurance.",Michael,Season 6,6x5
32554,I think you knew exactly what you were doing. And frankly I think you were being a total and utter jerk.,Michael,Season 6,6x5
32556,You suck!,Michael,Season 6,6x5
32557,Okay that's-,Dwight,Season 6,6x5
32558,And I'm not gonna buy your stupid insurance.,Michael,Season 6,6x5
32559,"That's good, let's wrap it up.",Dwight,Season 6,6x5
32560,"How about that? The only person that actually needs insurance is you, if you show your face around here again, got it?",Michael,Season 6,6x5
32562,Doubt it. [disconnects call],Michael,Season 6,6x5
32564,What a tool. [Dwight and Andy exchange looks] What?,Michael,Season 6,6x5
32566,No. What do you mean?,Michael,Season 6,6x5
32567,"We just told you he wasn't mafia, so you wouldn't be scared.",Dwight,Season 6,6x5
32568,What?,Michael,Season 6,6x5
32569,You successfully backed down the mob!,Dwight,Season 6,6x5
32571,Oh man. I should be mad at you guys. But I'm not.,Michael,Season 6,6x5
32572,"So I looked him in the eye and I said, 'Not today Grotti, Not today. And not tomorrow, and not the next day. Or the day after that. And you can tell all your friends that if I see them, then they're already dead.' I said something like that.",Michael,Season 6,6x5
32573,Very close.,Dwight,Season 6,6x5
32575,Erin?,Michael,Season 6,6x5
32577,Coffee?,Michael,Season 6,6x5
32579,"Not from the kitchen. Stop and Shop. If it's not Stop and Shop, I send it back.",Michael,Season 6,6x5
32581,Large. If it's a medium I send it back. If it's an extra large I send it back.,Michael,Season 6,6x5
32583,Go.  Any questions?,Michael,Season 6,6x5
32584,[on phone] Are you kidding me?,Pam,Season 6,6x5
32586,"Listen our credit card has been cancelled and we have to deal with that, and I really can't handle the fact that you're calling us here!",Pam,Season 6,6x5
32588,Oh I will. I will Kevin. I will make that my top priority.,Pam,Season 6,6x5
32594,It was.,Jim,Season 6,6x6
32595,It really was.,Pam,Season 6,6x6
32596,Really was.,Jim,Season 6,6x6
32598,Puerto Rico was awesome.,Jim,Season 6,6x6
32599,"Oh my gosh. The honeymoon was great. We met this other couple at the resort, Frank and Benny. We hung out with them a lot.",Pam,Season 6,6x6

32611,"Hi, Michael.",Pam,Season 6,6x6
32612,"Oh, I haven't see you since my accident that I had when I fell- I fell into the pool of acid, eyes first. Blind guy.",Michael,Season 6,6x6
32613,Blind-guy McSqueezy. How do I describe it? It is a character I've been workshopping whose lack of vision gets him into all sorts of trouble. The women in my improve class absolutely hate him. [groans],Michael,Season 6,6x6
32615,Some candy.,Pam,Season 6,6x6
32617,That's it.,Pam,Season 6,6x6
32619,"[behind Pam, acting out blind-guy, groaning]",Michael,Season 6,6x6
32620,It's good to be home.,Pam,Season 6,6x6
32621,This conversation has two items on the agenda.,Dwight,Season 6,6x6
32622,Do we have a conversation scheduled?,Jim,Season 6,6x6
32623,"Number one, do not leave your things on my desk. It's not some kind of personal pen receptacle for you. I don't care how high they promote you, which brings me to item number two... I never formally congratulated you on your promotion, so I'd just like to say... [high voice, holding up wooden mallard] con-quack-ulations!",Dwight,Season 6,6x6
32624,"Wow, that's... really thoughtful of you, Dwight, thank you.",Jim,Season 6,6x6
32625,"[duck voice] You're welcome! [quacks, laughs]",Dwight,Season 6,6x6
32626,"I inserted a listening device into the belly of the mallard. Now I can observe Jim, trap Jim, and destroy Jim, just like in the Bavarian fairy tale. Only this time, the mallard skins the toad alive. And of course in this version you lose the whole veiled critique of the Kaiser thing.",Dwight,Season 6,6x6
32627,I'm sorry to have been bugging you all these years.,Dwight,Season 6,6x6
32628,It's a real handsome duck.,Jim,Season 6,6x6
32629,"Mallard. Okay, I'll get out of your hair.",Dwight,Season 6,6x6
32630,Hey!,Pam,Season 6,6x6
32632,"Uh, we brought back some Puerto Rican candy.",Pam,Season 6,6x6
32634,Awesome! I'll leave it up here so everyone can enjoy it.,Pam,Season 6,6x6
32636,[laughs] I think it'll be okay.,Pam,Season 6,6x6
32638,Great.,Pam,Season 6,6x6
32640,I have recently taken a lover.,Michael,Season 6,6x6
32641,"Well, that's great. Congratulations. Who's the lucky lady?",Jim,Season 6,6x6
32642,Pam's mom.,Michael,Season 6,6x6
32643,What?,Jim,Season 6,6x6
32644,"Pam's mom, Helene. Remember from your wedding?",Michael,Season 6,6x6
32645,You're messing with me.,Jim,Season 6,6x6
32646,About what?,Michael,Season 6,6x6
32647,You did not have sex with Pam's mom.,Jim,Season 6,6x6
32648,"Oh, big time.",Michael,Season 6,6x6
32649,What kind of car does she drive?,Jim,Season 6,6x6
32650,She drives a green camry.,Michael,Season 6,6x6
32651,[expletive],Jim,Season 6,6x6
32652,And the seats go all the way down. All the way down.,Michael,Season 6,6x6
32653,Oh my God. [Michael bangs the table] Oh my God.,Jim,Season 6,6x6
32654,[laughs] What?,Michael,Season 6,6x6
32655,"Okay, never tell Pam, and secondly-",Jim,Season 6,6x6
32656,"Okay, good, a pact. A pact. Although I may have to break it tonight when Helene and I tell Pam over dinner. You alright?",Michael,Season 6,6x6
32657,Oh my God.,Jim,Season 6,6x6
32659,"Not now, Toby, my God!",Jim,Season 6,6x6
32661,"Get the hell out of here, idiot.",Michael,Season 6,6x6
32663,"Okay, as far as dinner tonight, cancel that, and please, for both our sakes, never, ever, ever see her again.",Jim,Season 6,6x6
32664,"I think you're underestimating Pam. I think more than anything, she wants me to be happy.",Michael,Season 6,6x6
32665,"No, not more than anything.",Jim,Season 6,6x6
32666,"Okay, I have a good thing with the mom-",Michael,Season 6,6x6
32667,Don't call her 'the mom.',Jim,Season 6,6x6

32671,"Okay, so we're good.",Jim,Season 6,6x6
32672,Yeah.,Michael,Season 6,6x6
32673,Can you change my dinner reservations from four people to two?,Michael,Season 6,6x6
32675,Sure. Thanks for asking.,Michael,Season 6,6x6
32677,Frank and beans!,Jim,Season 6,6x6
32678,"Frank and beans! [both laugh] So what'd we decide for Michael, the bottle of rum, or the seashell alarm clock?",Pam,Season 6,6x6
32679,You know what? Can I have the weekend to decide?,Jim,Season 6,6x6
32680,"Bottle of rum it is. [takes package out of bag] Alright, shall we?",Pam,Season 6,6x6
32681,"You know what, I am really slammed, trying to catch up on everything here and I know that Michael's slammed too. So, maybe we should do this when things are a little less crazy.",Jim,Season 6,6x6
32682,"Come on, it'll take two seconds.",Pam,Season 6,6x6
32683,"No, it- [high-pitched feedback as Jim starts to leave, feedback changes as he moves, turns over the mallard to see the listening devics, sighs, places mallard back on the desk]",Jim,Season 6,6x6
32684,"[unwraps rum gift] Oh, wow.",Michael,Season 6,6x6

32692,"Yeah, no, it's nobody.",Michael,Season 6,6x6
32693,[laughs] I don't know. I think Michael has a date.,Pam,Season 6,6x6
32694,[chuckles] Hmm... no.,Michael,Season 6,6x6
32695,[laughs] I think you have a date.,Pam,Season 6,6x6
32696,I don't.,Michael,Season 6,6x6
32697,Come on.,Pam,Season 6,6x6
32698,"Uh, I think we should just drop it... 'cause obviously he doesn't want to talk about it.",Jim,Season 6,6x6
32699,"[sighs] I don't deserve this, guys.",Michael,Season 6,6x6
32700,"Yes, you do.",Jim,Season 6,6x6
32701,"No, I don't.",Michael,Season 6,6x6
32702,Just take the parrot.,Jim,Season 6,6x6
32703,[long exhale],Michael,Season 6,6x6
32704,"Okay, back to the old grind.",Jim,Season 6,6x6
32705,I was probably going to break up with her anyway.,Michael,Season 6,6x6
32706,"Oh, that's too bad.",Pam,Season 6,6x6
32707,Don't-,Jim,Season 6,6x6
32708,"Pam, it is very complicated. There are a lot of moving parts here.",Michael,Season 6,6x6
32709,Sounds complicated.,Jim,Season 6,6x6

32711,"Yeah, but I mean, if you really like this person, then you should see where it goes.",Pam,Season 6,6x6
32712,You want me to be happy?,Michael,Season 6,6x6
32713,Of course.,Pam,Season 6,6x6
32714,"Part of the problem is, she is the mother of a close friend of mine.",Michael,Season 6,6x6
32715,Oh.,Pam,Season 6,6x6
32716,"More than a friend, a co-worker.",Michael,Season 6,6x6

32721,"[screams out in the parking lot, Michael watches from his office window]",Pam,Season 6,6x6
32722,"[to Michael] You seem tense. Hey, you want me to give you the chills?",Dwight,Season 6,6x6

32727,"I'm sleeping with Pam's mom. Sometimes, dinner.",Michael,Season 6,6x6
32728,"...the blood is gushing down, the blood is gushing down... You know, I really would have appreciated a heads-up that you were into dating mothers. I would have introduced you to mine.",Dwight,Season 6,6x6
32729,"[outside, on cell phone] How could you do this to me? He's my boss! How many times have I complained about him to you? No, I am not being dramatic, you are being crazy!",Pam,Season 6,6x6
32730,[singsong voice] Who wants a hot chocolate?,Jim,Season 6,6x6
32731,Thank you.,Pam,Season 6,6x6
32732,"[sighs] Oh, so Dwight gave me this wooden mallard as a gift, and I found a recording device in it. Yes. So, I think if I played it just right I can get Dwight to play out the plot of National Treasure.",Jim,Season 6,6x6
32733,You need to be more upset about this. She's your mother too now. Your mother is sleeping with Michael Scott.,Pam,Season 6,6x6

32750,"That was a hit job.  If you read the Dunder Mifflin press release it clearly states that they had absolutely nothing to do with that particular cancer cluster.  So if there is a lesson to be learned here and I'm not sure that there is, it is that in order to help our communities, we need to put other people's needs ahead of our own.",Michael,Season 6,6x6

33138,"Well, you know what? You're right, Phyllis, but I've been there before. I've seen that pond. This is the thing, I am a world class moron. That's the problem.",Michael,Season 6,6x7
33139,"Michael, please. Stop it now. You're embarrassing yourself.",Dwight,Season 6,6x7
33140,"It's ok. We're having fun. It's not actually the first time I've been embarrassed by a pond. In high school, the girls volleyball team always used to hrow me into the frozen lake. Four years in a row. Oh... it was freezing. [Jim signals for making to stop] No. No. No. Oh, this is even worse. [Michael begins to lose his cool] Couple weeks ago I went to get a new cellphone and I wanted on of those packages where you have, you know, the friends- the five- the friends and family thing and the guys was like, 'Who are your 5 friends?' and I'm, like, 'Uh... ' I didn't even know I couldn't even think. [realizing he's going downhill] Oh, my God. It was so embarrassing. That was- oh. I don't even have Jan's cell phone number and I hate her! She won't give it to me. I was like, 'Oh, I guess I'm a loser. 'A luh-whooooo a za her'.  Too far! God! Thanks a lot, man. Thanks for the advice.",Michael,Season 6,6x7
33146,Hey. Who wants to watch Michael's pond dive? My roommate's friend is the night janitor over there. He swiped the security tape for me and he's bringing it over.,Michael,Season 6,6x7
33147,"Mm... I'm, know what? Maybe we should go easy on Michael, guys. You know, you watch that tape and you're gonna have to stay late for more sensitity training, so...",Jim,Season 6,6x7
33150,"Yeah, I guess.",Pam,Season 6,6x7
33152,"If I'm being completely honest, I could've done without the belly kiss.",Pam,Season 6,6x7
33154,Yeah. Way too much.,Pam,Season 6,6x7
33156,"I mean, what the hell was that?",Pam,Season 6,6x7

33160,You're fantsy involves comparison shopping birthing classes?,Pam,Season 6,6x7
33162,Hmm.,Pam,Season 6,6x7

33168,Ah.,Pam,Season 6,6x7
33171,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Ok. Yeah. We're not watchin' this.",Jim,Season 6,6x7
33173,What happened to 'Do Not Mock'?,Jim,Season 6,6x7
33175,That will inevitably lead to mocking. So...,Jim,Season 6,6x7
33177,Is this the tape of me falling?,Michael,Season 6,6x7
33182,Guys. Michael can't handle this and as your boss I'm saying we're not watching it.,Jim,Season 6,6x7
33183,No. It's ok. Watch it. He can't fire all of you.,Michael,Season 6,6x7

33187,"I am a grown-up, Jim.",Michael,Season 6,6x7
33191,See what?,Jim,Season 6,6x7
33193,"Oscar, yes. You're right to stop it. Thank you. Eject it.",Jim,Season 6,6x7
33195,Play it again. [everyone has the same reaction as before] He purposefully leaned away and let you fall in.,Dwight,Season 6,6x7
33196,Oh... man. I thinke when I started to see you go in I think I just froze.,Jim,Season 6,6x7
33197,I don't think you froze.,Michael,Season 6,6x7
33198,It's a killer new dance move. [re-enacts leaning back] Do you wanna talk in your office?,Jim,Season 6,6x7
33200,I didn't ask you. [back to Michael] Would you like to talk? [walks away],Jim,Season 6,6x7
33201,Judas.,Dwight,Season 6,6x7
33202,"Jim is my enemy. But it turns out that Jim is also his own worst enemy. And the enemy of my enemy is my friend. So, Jim is actually my friend. But... because he is his own worst enemy, the enemy of my friend is my enemy. So, actually Jim is my enemy. But-",Dwight,Season 6,6x7
33203,"I should've grabbed you. I'm sorry. Look, I thought I could've done today's sales call alone. I mean, I may never be as good a salesman as you are, but I at least need the chance to do the job.",Jim,Season 6,6x7
33204,Jim is jealous of me? Jim is jealous of me.,Michael,Season 6,6x7
33207,Oscar's a douche.,Michael,Season 6,6x7
33208,[laughing] He's alright.,Jim,Season 6,6x7
33209,"No. He's a- yeah, he's alright. Ok. [holds door open as they exit]",Michael,Season 6,6x7
33210,Thanks Michael.,Jim,Season 6,6x7
33211,You're welcome. Whoa! [leans back] Almost fell. [they both laugh],Michael,Season 6,6x7

33214,Ok.,Pam,Season 6,6x7
33216,Mmm-hmm.,Pam,Season 6,6x7
33218,"No. It was a total waste of time. Um... it was fun, though, because I got to spend the day with Andy Bernard. He's really cool.",Pam,Season 6,6x7
33220,"Yeah, he is.",Pam,Season 6,6x7
33222,That's... right. He's like Marlon Brando.,Pam,Season 6,6x7

33233,Good morning Michael.,Dwight,Season 6,6x8
33234,Morning Dwight.,Michael,Season 6,6x8
33235,Hungry?,Dwight,Season 6,6x8
33236,No.  I had a fish stick sandwich.  Actually I had two fish stick sandwiches.  My girlfriend didn't want hers.  Because I guess I'm the only aphrodisiac she needs.,Michael,Season 6,6x8
33237,Fish sticks are not an aphrodisiac.,Dwight,Season 6,6x8
33238,"Well, yeah...",Michael,Season 6,6x8
33239,You're thinking of deer penis.,Dwight,Season 6,6x8
33240,It worked.,Michael,Season 6,6x8
33241,Regardless.  That was over two hours ago and it is now a scientific fact that you are hungry.  [holds up tray] Bagel?,Dwight,Season 6,6x8
33242,I don't mind if I do.,Michael,Season 6,6x8

33247,Okay. [walks out of Michael's office] You owe me.,Dwight,Season 6,6x8
33248,Can't a guy just buy some bagels for his friends so they'll owe him a favor which he can use to get someone fired who stole a co-manager position from him anymore?  Geez.  When did everyone get so cynical?,Dwight,Season 6,6x8
33249,"Pam, would you care for a bagel?",Dwight,Season 6,6x8
33250,"Oh, no thank you.",Pam,Season 6,6x8

33252,I have an early lunch.,Pam,Season 6,6x8
33253,"Michael's been trying to get Jim and me to hang out ever since he started dating my mom.  I don't know.  I really hoped this thing would just die out, but today he's planning a birthday lunch for my mom and we have to go.  No way out.  No way out.",Pam,Season 6,6x8
33259,Hey!  [gets up to greet Helene] Hey. Happy birthday.,Pam,Season 6,6x8
33261,[comes over to hug them both] My girls.  There they are. [Pam walks away],Michael,Season 6,6x8
33262,"Birthday lunch.  Birthday lunch-- there is no better medicine than birthday lunch.  It'll cure all of your 'Gee I don't know if Michael should be dating my mother' and fixes all occurrences of 'I don't really see them together'.  So, open wide Pam and take a big old spoonful of birthday lunch medicine.  Take with food.",Michael,Season 6,6x8
33264,I think you guys all remember my mom from the wedding.,Pam,Season 6,6x8

33275,Hey--,Michael,Season 6,6x8
33276,Kevin!,Pam,Season 6,6x8
33277,"Please, Kevin.  You're fired.  [Kevin looks at Jim; Jim shakes his head]  Sorry, sorry.  Work with a bunch of idiots.  Shall we go?",Michael,Season 6,6x8

33307,There you go!,Dwight,Season 6,6x8
33309,"Oh... goodness... thanks.  You know, here's a healthy fitness tip.  If you clench your buttocks together while walking you can really take the pressure off your knees.",Dwight,Season 6,6x8

33335,"Michael, you did all this?",Pam,Season 6,6x8
33336,Not about taking credit.  Let's just say we all did it.,Michael,Season 6,6x8

33351,Congratulations.,Michael,Season 6,6x8
33352,The only time you should care about a woman's age is if she is too young for you and I am not robbing the cradle.  If anything I am robbing the grave.,Michael,Season 6,6x8

33362,Maybe.,Pam,Season 6,6x8
33363,Helene?,Michael,Season 6,6x8

33369,Well there's no jumping in a triathlon.,Michael,Season 6,6x8
33371,You're thinking of the broad jump.  Would you try-- bungee jumping?,Michael,Season 6,6x8
33373,Snowboarding?,Michael,Season 6,6x8
33375,I might.,Michael,Season 6,6x8
33377,[sighs] Nothing.  Just life-- and doing things-- before you die. I don't know.,Michael,Season 6,6x8

33408,Yeah.,Pam,Season 6,6x8
33410,That's really nice Michael.,Pam,Season 6,6x8

33435,"Helene I think you're a wonderful person and I-- God-- I've enjoyed dating you and being your boyfriend so much.  But I have to consider Pam's feelings as a friend and a co-worker I can not in good conscience continue to date you, when I know what this is doing to her.",Michael,Season 6,6x8
33436,"Michael.  Michael ,it's okay.",Pam,Season 6,6x8
33437,No it's not.,Michael,Season 6,6x8

33439,Wow.  That just-- you've really grown.,Michael,Season 6,6x8
33440,Well--,Pam,Season 6,6x8
33441,"[covering eyes] Thank you Pam. And I hope you are as gracious during this next part.  Helene, once again you are a wonderful person and you have lived a great life and I envy it.  And I want it someday, but just in the future.  You need somebody who-- who understands your references.  Who is Kafkaesque?  I've never-- I don't know him.  There's another woman.  And her name is Italy... and skydiving... and bungee jumping.",Michael,Season 6,6x8
33442,"Okay, so--",Jim,Season 6,6x8

33576,I don't know.,Michael,Season 6,6x8

33578,"As I watched Pam's big, strong hand coming towards my face I saw my entire life flash before my eyes.  And guess what?  I have four kids.  And I have a hover-car and a hover-house.

33600,That is correct.  Unless there happened to be measles present.,Dwight,Season 6,6x9
33601,"So let's just say that Dwight has come at you with the throat punch.  Now how would you, Dwight, defend against it?",Jim,Season 6,6x9
33602,Easy.  Allow me to demonstrate.  I am attacking myself with a throat punch.  Here it comes. [gives himself a fake throat punch]  Block.  Grasp wrist as such. [grasps wrist],Dwight,Season 6,6x9
33603,"And what if he comes at you with the other hand, because he does have two.",Jim,Season 6,6x9
33604,"Good point.  Second, throat punch, absorb the blow. [gives himself another throat punch and proceeds to both attack and defend himself]  Groin punch, hip block, elbow to the gut.  Uh oh, up to the nose.  No, you're not.  Ow!  Oh!",Dwight,Season 6,6x9

33607,You two are so evenly matched I don't know how one of you is going to get the upper hand.,Jim,Season 6,6x9

33838,"Get the keys out of my purse, start the car. [Jim and Pam slowly back out of the office, Pam has her weapon trained on everyone and then they run out]",Pam,Season 6,6x9
33840,Bow down before Recyclops.,Dwight,Season 6,6x10
33841,"Five years ago, corporate said we had to start a recycling program for Earth Day so Dwight took the lead on that and introduced us to a very close friend of his named Recyclops.",Jim,Season 6,6x10
33842,"Happy Earth Day, everyone. I'm Recyclops. Did you know that an old milk carton can be sawed in half and used as a planter?",Dwight,Season 6,6x10
33843,The next year he really stepped things up.,Jim,Season 6,6x10
33844,Who has put a number seven plastic in a number four bin?,Dwight,Season 6,6x10
33845,A year after that Recylcops really began to take shape.,Jim,Season 6,6x10
33846,Recylops will drown you in your over-watered lawns.,Dwight,Season 6,6x10
33847,Then tragedy struck Recyclops when his fictional planet was attacked by some other fictitious thing... I can't remember.,Jim,Season 6,6x10
33848,Recyclops will have his revenge.,Dwight,Season 6,6x10
33849,I think this was also the year he renounced Earth Day and vowed to the destroy the planet he once loved.,Jim,Season 6,6x10
33850,"Oh my God, you guys, look. It's Recyclops.",Pam,Season 6,6x10
33851,Recyclops destroys! [starts tearing through the office],Dwight,Season 6,6x10
33853,Yes.,Dwight,Season 6,6x10
33855,Polluticorn wishes. [starts spraying the office with something],Dwight,Season 6,6x10
33857,Humans are terrible for the environment.,Dwight,Season 6,6x10
33858,The thing I like most about Recyclops is that he's creating a different world for our child.,Pam,Season 6,6x10
33859,Mmm.,Jim,Season 6,6x10
33860,A world where you truly can be anything you want.,Pam,Season 6,6x10
33861,"God bless you, Recyclops. And your cold robot heart. [Dwight throws an aluminum can towards the recycling bin and misses]",Jim,Season 6,6x10
33862,"[seated] Ok. Ok. How 'bout this? [rises, waves, sits back down]",Michael,Season 6,6x10
33863,That's great.,Pam,Season 6,6x10
33864,"I want it to be better than 'Great', Pam. How 'bout I remain seated... and I just do a little bit of a nod. Sort of a humble thing. [demonstrates]",Michael,Season 6,6x10
33865,Sure.,Pam,Season 6,6x10
33866,Nope. Then my face is down. They can't see my face.,Michael,Season 6,6x10
33868,"Alan Brand is the CEO of the company, if title's important to you, has personally invited moi to go to New York to the shareholder's meeting  and sit up on the stage with the board of directors. And at some point they are going to introduce me as the most successful branch manager that they have. And then Michael Scott turns and waves to the crowd... and the crowd goes wild.",Michael,Season 6,6x10
33870,Don't do the twirl.,Pam,Season 6,6x10
33872,The twirl sucks.,Dwight,Season 6,6x10
33875,Ok. Obviously I'm not going to do the twirl. I only did it because I nailed the wave.,Michael,Season 6,6x10
33877,"I am not going to do the twirl. Alright? It's not even a twirl, it's a spin. I might do the spin.",Michael,Season 6,6x10
33879,"Ok, Oscar, I don't need the whole enchilada just the bullet points.",Michael,Season 6,6x10
33881,"Well, could you condense it please?",Michael,Season 6,6x10
33884,"It's not a limo. It's a town car. Town cars are actually better, though. Better torque. Better handling.",Michael,Season 6,6x10
33887,They sent a limo.,Michael,Season 6,6x10
33888,Town cars suck. Town car is something that a company sends when they're in trouble. A limousine is something that a company sends when they have cause for celebration. And in this case I think we are celebrating me.,Michael,Season 6,6x10
33889,"[everyone is rushing down the stairs to see the limo] Oh, wait. Wait. Wow. Wow! Oh, no way. Look at that.",Michael,Season 6,6x10

33907,Definitely.,Michael,Season 6,6x10

33913,"Hey, Ryan. Could you start consolidating all our Rolodex information into Outlook?",Jim,Season 6,6x10
33915,But if the company doesn't go under then we'll finally have all our contacts in one program.,Jim,Season 6,6x10
33917,Could go either way.,Jim,Season 6,6x10
33919,Maybe we should just wait and find out.,Jim,Season 6,6x10
33921,Ok.,Jim,Season 6,6x10
33923,Nah. Might as well do it now.,Jim,Season 6,6x10
33925,I will have to answer.,Michael,Season 6,6x10
33926,I'll ask you a question.,Dwight,Season 6,6x10
33928,Michael Scott you run the most profitable branch of Dunder Mifflin. How do you do it?,Dwight,Season 6,6x10
33929,"No, no. That's too hard. Say your name is Zamboni and then I will say, 'Well, we're sort of on thin ice.' [they all laugh] I won't say that. I'll something like that.",Michael,Season 6,6x10
33931,"Oh, my god. This is it.",Michael,Season 6,6x10
33933,Yes.,Michael,Season 6,6x10
33935,"Oh, hi.",Michael,Season 6,6x10

33956,Ah. [bows] Your eminence.,Michael,Season 6,6x10
33958,"Coming through. Che, che, che, che, che, che. [spots microphone and gets in line, sees an empty mic and attempts to get there first] Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. [a line appears from nowhere] Ah. Damn it. [ heads back to the original line which is now even longer] Wha- okay [grunts]",Dwight,Season 6,6x10
33959,"I was hoping to lob Michael his softball question early. I wanted to swing by the garment district, pick up a few crates of my shirts. I got a shirt guy.",Dwight,Season 6,6x10
33964,How is he gonna have grandkids?,Dwight,Season 6,6x10
33965,You guys ever protect the president?,Michael,Season 6,6x10
33967,What about Madonna? Or Obama twins? Anybody famous?,Michael,Season 6,6x10

33978,No. You will not.,Dwight,Season 6,6x10
33980,"Oh, I'm sorry. Were you raised in a household with no consequences?",Dwight,Season 6,6x10
33982,Oh. If onlys and justs were candies and nuts then every day would be Erntedankfest.,Dwight,Season 6,6x10
33984,[loudly applauds] Yes.,Dwight,Season 6,6x10
33986,"Hey, Phyllis. Are you just getting back from lunch now?",Jim,Season 6,6x10
33988,Ok. You shouldn't be telling me that stuff and also shouldn't be taking two hour lunches without telling me.,Jim,Season 6,6x10
33990,I care about them and I'm just as much of a boss as Michael. [Stanley laughs] What's so funny? I'm a co-manager.,Jim,Season 6,6x10
33993,"Well - who? How did you? Who, who told you this?",Jim,Season 6,6x10
33997,Ok. Who else has heard the rumor that I am not as much in charge as Michael? [everyone raises there hands - including Pam],Jim,Season 6,6x10
33998,Stuff gets around. I don't participate.,Pam,Season 6,6x10
33999,Who here heard it from Ryan?,Jim,Season 6,6x10
34001,Yes.,Jim,Season 6,6x10
34003,"I am just as much of a boss as Michael and I can do anything that Michael can do. Alright?  Who here believes that I have as much power as Michael? [Pam, after a moment,  is the only one who raises her hand]",Jim,Season 6,6x10
34004,I forgot I have to support him no matter what. Close one.,Pam,Season 6,6x10
34010,"Hey, hey, hey. I'm sorry. These are not criminals. They are nice. They invited me to come here today. They invited me to their hospitality suite where I  had free food and it was delicious.

34012,Yes.,Michael,Season 6,6x10
34017,I gotta make an example out of him. Should I just fire him?,Jim,Season 6,6x10
34018,Can you actually fire people?,Pam,Season 6,6x10
34019,"To be honest, I don't know, but maybe I could just yell at him in front of people.",Jim,Season 6,6x10
34020,"Well, I can't really imagine you yelling at anyone.",Pam,Season 6,6x10
34021,"Oh, well I yell. You've heard me yell.",Jim,Season 6,6x10
34022,"Oh. Ok. I've heard you exclaim. Like the time you said, 'Hey, look. We parked over here!'.",Pam,Season 6,6x10
34023,"Well, that was apple-picking day and there's no need to yell that day, you know. I was just excited to find the car. Perfect end to a perfect day.",Jim,Season 6,6x10
34024,"Well, you'll figure it out.",Pam,Season 6,6x10
34027,"[board of directors has started to exit] Yeah, well, that's not gonna happen. That's not gonna happen. We'll be back with some answers. [a few murmurs from the crowd of 'What answers?'] I - ok. I know that you're mad at me and you're mad at all them -",Michael,Season 6,6x10
34029,"Ok. Alright. We are gonna - we're gonna go out there during this break and we are gonna come back with a plan. We're gonna come back with a plan for you. It's a 45 day plan. 45 days to get us back on track. [crowd starts to agree and perk up] 45 points. It's a 45 day/45 point. One point per day. We get the 45 points we are back in business. [crowd applauds] And you can take that to the bank. [applause continue] And Limo Lady, we are going completely carbon neutral. [crowd has gotten very excited and is cheering] I love you, New York! [Michael does the spin and leaves the stage - then runs back across the stage] You. You.",Michael,Season 6,6x10
34030,"Hey, Ryan. How's it going?",Jim,Season 6,6x10
34032,Mmm-hmm.,Jim,Season 6,6x10
34034,"Simple data entry, though. So there's really only one way to do it.",Jim,Season 6,6x10
34036,You know what?,Jim,Season 6,6x10
34038,I think I know the problem.,Jim,Season 6,6x10
34040,I think you seem distracted.,Jim,Season 6,6x10
34042,"But, you know what? I came up with something and I think it's really gonna help.",Jim,Season 6,6x10
34044,"I am, too. Let me show you.",Jim,Season 6,6x10
34045,Wow. Things are really picking up.,Michael,Season 6,6x10
34047,What?,Michael,Season 6,6x10
34049,I did wave. I did a lot more than wave.,Michael,Season 6,6x10
34051,"We tell them the plan, right?",Michael,Season 6,6x10
34053,"Here's what we're gonna do. The 45 day thing that I outlined, we go with that. Day 45, company saved. Day 44, go. What do we got? We have 15 minutes.",Michael,Season 6,6x10
34055,Just whatever comes to mind. Shout it out.,Michael,Season 6,6x10
34057,I am the guy who roused that crowd.,Michael,Season 6,6x10
34059,Got them on their feet.,Michael,Season 6,6x10
34061,They were so happy down there.,Michael,Season 6,6x10

34066,"Well, I'm texting him, so.",Michael,Season 6,6x10
34068,"It's done. [Oscar, sitting in the lobby, receives a text]",Michael,Season 6,6x10
34069,"Oh. There he is. Come on in. Come on in. Gentleman, I would like you to meet Oscar. Come on in. Don't be shy. This is Oscar Martinez. Oscar, why don't you come over here. Let me present you. Step up. Step up there. Oscar is an accountant extraordinaire at the Scranton branch and he has a wonderful idea as to how to get us out of this murky, murky situation. Take it away. [Oscar stands there stunned]",Michael,Season 6,6x10
34070,"I think this is really gonna help. If you could just hold up here one second. [addresses the whole office] Hey, guys. Quick announcement. If I could just have everyone's attention. [turns back to Ryan] I just figured you needed a place where you can concentrate and not be bothered by bothering people.",Jim,Season 6,6x10
34072,"Let me show you what I mean. [Jim opens the closet door to reveal a work station] Your new office. How great is that, right? For a job well done. Well, not done.",Jim,Season 6,6x10
34074,Right.,Jim,Season 6,6x10
34076,[laughs] You're a good kid. You know what? It gets bigger once you're in there. Enjoy it. [shuts the door and walks to his office],Jim,Season 6,6x10
34079,Tell them what you told me. This is genius.,Michael,Season 6,6x10
34081,Tell them about the cash flow and the dumping of properties and - this is all -,Michael,Season 6,6x10
34083,It's all good. It's all good stuff. Lay it on them.,Michael,Season 6,6x10
34085,That wasn't what you were saying to me. He was much more articulate and that was better. Much better.,Michael,Season 6,6x10
34087,"O-kay. Oh... hey, hey. [follows Oscar into the hall] What are you doing?",Michael,Season 6,6x10
34089,"Wow, man. That -",Michael,Season 6,6x10
34091,That was embarrassing.,Michael,Season 6,6x10
34093,"For me, too. You embarrassed me.",Michael,Season 6,6x10
34095,"Well, that was a waste of a text. Let's get down to brass tacks. I think that we might be in trouble. We don't seem to have a plan so I'm thinking I go down there. Maybe rattle off a few jokes. Congressman could follow.",Michael,Season 6,6x10
34097,"Uh, I'm not a moron. Time after time my branch leads in sales. I have personally won over 17 Dundie awards. So, I am not a moron and I am just trying to help, you know? So... you're the moron.",Michael,Season 6,6x10
34098,[zipping through the hall while texting],Michael,Season 6,6x10
34099,"Yes it is a thrill to be honored by one's company. To have the people that you work for stop for a minute and say, 'Wow. Great job.'  That is what it is all about. Not the perks. Perks? The perks. I could take or leave the perks.  Limos are for people who make the company money not lose millions and have no plan. So we're leaving early. After all, we are the only ones with anything to celebrate.",Michael,Season 6,6x10
34101,"[running out of the building with Oscar, Andy, and Dwight] Oscar! Oscar! Come on!  There he is! There he is! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!  Scranton! Scranton! Scranton! Dunder Mifflin!",Michael,Season 6,6x10
34103,"Dwight Schrute, Scranton branch. I just want to say that I have been standing in this line all day and if this line is any indication of how this company is being run then we are in big trouble. [cheers from crowd] Thank you. Right. I know. And I just want to say that I believe that there are options out there. [crowd still applauding] A take a number option like they have in a deli. What about line varieties? Like an express line for quick comments of ten words or less. They can move much more efficiently. What about ropes along the lines that you can hold on to.",Dwight,Season 6,6x10
34105,Yeah.,Dwight,Season 6,6x10
34107,"Yeah, Have a seat.",Michael,Season 6,6x11
34109,"Okay, right there is the problem.  There have been reports around the office that you have been talking baby talk.",Michael,Season 6,6x11
34111,I have it on good authority that you said the following. [hands Andy a notecard]  Can you read that back to me?,Michael,Season 6,6x11
34113,Mmm-hmm.,Michael,Season 6,6x11
34115,Okay.,Michael,Season 6,6x11
34117,"You are also on record as saying 'wittle-ittle,' 'footy-wutties,' 'nummies,' 'jammies,' 'make boom-boom,' 'widiculous,' and 'wode iwand.'",Michael,Season 6,6x11
34119,You can't be a baby in the office.  It makes me look like I hire babies.,Michael,Season 6,6x11
34121,"Okay, who said that?",Michael,Season 6,6x11
34123,"[Elvis voice] Well, thank you... thank you a lot.  And for what it's worth I think your baby voice is tops.",Michael,Season 6,6x11
34125,"[as Elvis] You're welcome, baby.",Michael,Season 6,6x11
34127,"Wait, are you the patient or the doctor?",Jim,Season 6,6x11
34129,"Wow, what do you put our chances at?",Jim,Season 6,6x11
34131,"Hmm, sounds risky.",Jim,Season 6,6x11
34134,"Wow, that's not such a bad idea.",Jim,Season 6,6x11
34136,Anything else?,Jim,Season 6,6x11
34139,Keep.,Michael,Season 6,6x11
34141,I want to keep those so I can see what I sent.,Michael,Season 6,6x11
34143,Keep.,Michael,Season 6,6x11
34145,For what?,Michael,Season 6,6x11
34147,Oh okay.  I don't know how those got on there...,Michael,Season 6,6x11
34149,Must be hackers.,Michael,Season 6,6x11
34150,Hey.  What's up?,Jim,Season 6,6x11
34151,"What if I told you I had done the worst thing ever, would you still want to be my friend?",Michael,Season 6,6x11
34152,Did you murder someone?,Jim,Season 6,6x11
34153,Worse than that.,Michael,Season 6,6x11
34155,Lurk much?  [Erin leaves] I miss Pam.,Michael,Season 6,6x11
34156,I think she's okay.,Jim,Season 6,6x11
34157,Is that what we're going for now?  'okay?'  We used to go for 'pretty good.',Michael,Season 6,6x11
34158,"Great.  Hey, how do you feel about starting an Employee of the Month program?",Jim,Season 6,6x11
34159,"Yeah, you know what, that actually might make me feel better.  I'm not in this for the trophies, but...",Michael,Season 6,6x11
34160,"You're not in it at all, because you can't be employee of the month, you're a manager.",Jim,Season 6,6x11
34161,"Well, technically, I'm a co-manager, and I barely have any responsibilities, but I work hard, I love this company, and for those reasons, I think I would make a good employee of the month.",Michael,Season 6,6x11
34162,It would look bad.  Sorry.,Jim,Season 6,6x11
34163,"It would look good, on my mantle.",Michael,Season 6,6x11
34165,Yeah!  Your idea.,Dwight,Season 6,6x11
34166,"My idea.  I just need Andy to think it's his idea.  So it won't get traced back to me.  In approximately six hours, Jim will get a phone call from David Wallace.  He will be fired.",Dwight,Season 6,6x11
34168,[glances at it] Looks great.,Pam,Season 6,6x11
34170,Okay. [picks up and reads sheet]  The Michael Scott Foundation is still in existence?,Pam,Season 6,6x11
34171,There you are.  I don't think we have finished with my Inbox.,Michael,Season 6,6x11
34175,"Michael, why did you promise that?",Pam,Season 6,6x11
34176,To change lives.,Michael,Season 6,6x11
34177,"No Michael, why would you promise that?",Pam,Season 6,6x11
34178,"Yeah, okay.  Call the school, cancel.  I can't go through with this.",Michael,Season 6,6x11
34180,"Michael, this is a terrible terrible thing you've done.",Pam,Season 6,6x11
34181,Well...,Michael,Season 6,6x11
34182,It's terrible.,Pam,Season 6,6x11
34183,No.,Michael,Season 6,6x11
34184,"Just terrible.  And the longer you put it off, the worse it's going to get.",Pam,Season 6,6x11
34185,"I just, I fell in love with those kids.  and I didn't want to see them fall victim to the system, so I made them a promise.  I told them that if they graduated from high school, I would pay for their college education.  I've made some empty promises in my life, but hands down, that was the most generous.",Michael,Season 6,6x11
34186,"Just tell me it is going to be okay, all right?",Michael,Season 6,6x11
34187,No!,Pam,Season 6,6x11
34188,"I'm not a bad person, I bring good news.  Like when I promised those kids I'd pay for college.  Okay, all right.",Michael,Season 6,6x11
34189,You have to tell them.,Pam,Season 6,6x11
34190,"Would you come with me?  You know, like old times, instead of... [makes yuck face at Erin]",Michael,Season 6,6x11
34192,"It's fine.  Erin, you're going to go.  And you're going to make sure Michael tells the truth.",Pam,Season 6,6x11
34193,"Agh, God, you know what, could this day get any worse?",Michael,Season 6,6x11
34194,"Hey Jimmy, what's up?",Dwight,Season 6,6x11
34195,Not much.,Jim,Season 6,6x11
34196,"Cool.  Very cool.  I bet if you tried, you could grow the best beard of anyone in this office.",Dwight,Season 6,6x11
34197,[laughs] Thanks Dwight.,Jim,Season 6,6x11
34198,That laugh is so infectious.,Dwight,Season 6,6x11
34199,You're creeping me out.  I'm gonna go.,Jim,Season 6,6x11
34200,I didn't mean any of those things I just said.  And you can expect the same from everyone in this office if you don't nip this whole Employee of the Month situation in the bud.  Make it about the work.,Dwight,Season 6,6x11
34201,"Let me guess, you think you should get it.",Jim,Season 6,6x11
34202,"This encompasses all available data.  Hours, tardiness, unconfirmed sick days, participation.  Everyone has been assigned a random number for total fairness and transparency.  Also, this should be accompanied by a monetary prize.",Dwight,Season 6,6x11
34203,"Well, in an ideal world...",Jim,Season 6,6x11
34204,"In an ideal world, I would have all ten fingers on my left hand, so my right hand could just be a fist for punching.",Dwight,Season 6,6x11
34205,"Okay, if it's all the same to you, I'm just going to take away 'Survival Skills' and 'Self-defense.'",Jim,Season 6,6x11
34206,I'm going to run this by Toby and Accounting and have him assemble the data.,Dwight,Season 6,6x11
34207,"That's okay, I'll do it.",Jim,Season 6,6x11
34209,"Hey, Mikela Lasker, how are you?",Michael,Season 6,6x11
34211,Good to see you.  Where's your saxaphone?,Michael,Season 6,6x11
34213,"Eigth grade graduation, she gave a rendition of When The Saints Go Marching In that would blow your freaking mind.",Michael,Season 6,6x11
34215,"Well, you didn't even hear it.",Michael,Season 6,6x11
34217,"Oh, good.",Michael,Season 6,6x11
34219,Sure.,Michael,Season 6,6x11
34222,"Oh, yeah.",Michael,Season 6,6x11
34224,"No, not at all.  Nope, come on.",Michael,Season 6,6x11
34225,"Oh, you know what?  You know what?  I shouldn't go in there.  I'm pretty busy, I should just...",Michael,Season 6,6x11
34227,Oh.,Michael,Season 6,6x11
34233,Wow!,Michael,Season 6,6x11
34234,"Hey, so Jim thought it would be ideal if we all pitched in-",Dwight,Season 6,6x11
34236,So Jim thought it would be ideal if we all pitched in a 20 for this whole Employee of the Month thing.,Dwight,Season 6,6x11
34238,He thought you were doing an incredible job last month.,Dwight,Season 6,6x11
34240,You seem suprised.,Dwight,Season 6,6x11
34242,"Hey buddy, so every-",Dwight,Season 6,6x11
34244,Five minutes ahead of schedule.  Right on schedule.,Dwight,Season 6,6x11
34247,"[crying] Oh, God.  Oh, God.",Michael,Season 6,6x11
34248,"Okay, ladies and gentlemen, Welcome.  I know you're all very excited, but no matter who gets this, I just want to say that you are all employees of the monthin my eyes.  And the winner is, employee number nine.  And that is?",Jim,Season 6,6x11
34252,"Oh, no!",Dwight,Season 6,6x11
34253,"Okay, wait, I was not... I did not-",Jim,Season 6,6x11
34255,"Guys, listen.  This was anonymous, all right?  There is no way I could've given it to myself because I didn't even know who was on here.  I just gave it to the employee with the highest overall score.",Jim,Season 6,6x11
34257,"Will everybody stop for a second, because obviously I'm not taking any of it.  A mistake has been made and we'll figure it out.  Second of all, there was no cash prize.",Jim,Season 6,6x11
34259,Dwight?,Jim,Season 6,6x11
34260,"Yeah, you said 'In an ideal world, there would be a cash prize.'  Isn't that what you said?",Dwight,Season 6,6x11
34261,"No, Dwight, I meant... Yes, in a perfect world, someone would get money.  But-",Jim,Season 6,6x11
34264,"All right.  Wow.  Um, I am never going to forget today.  Not a chance.  I don't think I could ever give back to you what you have given me today.  Who here has done something stupid in their lives?  Like skipped out on study hall or mix up the difference between 'A' gym and 'B' gym, that sort of thing?  Show of hands, anybody, yes, a bunch of you, okay.  Well, me too, I've done something stupid which I would like to share.  Ummm. [period bell rings] Should we go?",Michael,Season 6,6x11
34266,"Ah.  All right.  I came here today because I promised you tuition and tuition is very valuable.  But you know what's invaluable is intuition.  You know what that is?  That is the ability to know when something is about to happen.  Does anybody out there have intuition?  Know what's gonna happen next?  Nobody?  Okay, you're going to make me say it.  All right, I am so proud of all of you.  Derrick, and Lefevre, and Ben, and Ayana, and Mikela, and Nikki and Jason, and... I'm sorry, okay, sorry spacing, your name?",Michael,Season 6,6x11
34268,"Well Zion, I am not going to be paying for your college tuition.  Which brings me to my main point and that is that I will not be able to pay for anybody's tuition.  I'm so, so sorry.",Michael,Season 6,6x11
34269,I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry.,Michael,Season 6,6x11
34271,"I lied to myself too.  I'm not a millionaire.  I thought I would be by the time I was 30, but I wasn't even close.  And then I thought maybe by the time I was 40, but by 40, I had less money than when I was 30.  Maybe by my 50s, I don't know.  I wanted to pay for your education.  I really did.  It was my dream.  Some people have evil drems, some people have selfish dreams or wet dreams.  My dream was in the right place.",Michael,Season 6,6x11
34273,"Okay, hold on.  Hold on.  Now I can't pay for your college.  But you don't have to go to class to be in class.  Online courses are a viable option to a traditional college experience.  And the best way to access those courses is with your own personal laptop. [students perk up] Which is rendered useless without batteries, and I have one for each of you.",Michael,Season 6,6x11
34275,"Hey, hold-hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  They're lithium.",Michael,Season 6,6x11
34276,"Look, there was a big mistake obviously, so I will fix it.  Okay?  This was your idea anyway.",Jim,Season 6,6x11
34278,Okay.,Jim,Season 6,6x11
34279,My idea!,Dwight,Season 6,6x11
34281,"Ok, for the record, I am pregnant and, obviously there has been some kind of a mistake, so why doesn't Jim just pick the next highest score on the list and we'll move on.",Pam,Season 6,6x11
34283,"Excellent idea, Pam.",Dwight,Season 6,6x11
34284,Thank you.,Pam,Season 6,6x11
34287,There must be some reasonable explanation for this.,Dwight,Season 6,6x11
34288,"No, wait, come on.  I didn't miss a day, I came in early, I stayed late, and I doubled my sales last month.",Pam,Season 6,6x11
34290,Yup.,Pam,Season 6,6x11
34291,"Guys, this isn't some elaborate scam, okay?",Jim,Season 6,6x11
34293,"Okay.  That is me, but I didn't order the cake.",Jim,Season 6,6x11
34296,He knew all along!,Dwight,Season 6,6x11
34299,"[imitating Kevin] This is Kevin Malone, is David there?",Dwight,Season 6,6x11
34301,"Tell him I'm mad at Jim, because he's asking us to give money to Pam.",Dwight,Season 6,6x11
34302,[imitating Stanley] This is Stanley Hudson.  Jim Halpert is a menace.,Dwight,Season 6,6x11
34303,"[imitating Toby] It's Toby Flenderson.  Listen, things are getting really bad down here.",Dwight,Season 6,6x11
34305,"Erin, can you give us a second?",Michael,Season 6,6x11
34307,"Yeah. Yeah. I know, I know, I know, I'm sorry.",Michael,Season 6,6x11
34309,What can I do?,Michael,Season 6,6x11
34311,"I can give you an extra laptop battery.  Not everyone took one.  How about this?  If you can find a way to pay for your college tuition, let me buy your books, okay?",Michael,Season 6,6x11
34313,"Yeah, well, I owe you that at least, right?",Michael,Season 6,6x11
34315,Really? Wow.  That's over $200 a year.,Michael,Season 6,6x11
34317,"For-okay, okay here's what I'm gonna do.  I'm going to write 4 checks for $1,000 each.  I'm going to date them one year apart.  Now, you are to use one check a year.  And please call me before you cash the check?  Cause I've got monies to move around.",Michael,Season 6,6x11
34319,That's a lot of zeroes.,Michael,Season 6,6x11
34320,This is Jim.,Jim,Season 6,6x11
34322,"Hey, uh David.",Jim,Season 6,6x11
34324,"So there was a little bit of a miscommunication here today.  It's been a little wild, uh, but I am on it.",Jim,Season 6,6x11
34326,No.,Jim,Season 6,6x11
34328,"I really don't know how it happened, David.",Jim,Season 6,6x11
34329,I know how it happened.,Dwight,Season 6,6x11
34331,"All right, it will not happen again.  I promise.",Jim,Season 6,6x11
34333,No!,Dwight,Season 6,6x11

34343,See you.,Jim,Season 6,6x11
34344,Damn it!,Dwight,Season 6,6x11
34346,Please stop.  15 lives.  I destroyed 15 young lives today.,Michael,Season 6,6x11

34352,I think you're doing a great job.,Michael,Season 6,6x11
34354,"What do you want from this job, provided the company doesn't go out of business?",Michael,Season 6,6x11

34424,"For several weeks, my Secret Santa has been giving me pieces of a machine that I've been attempting to assemble. I'm suspicious of this because I had the exact same idea, for catching Osama bin Laden. I would simply send him a different piece each day.

34444,"If this were Russia, yeah sure. Everyone would go to one Santa, and there would be a line around the block and once you sat on her lap and she'd ask you what you wanted, you would say probably 'freedom.' At which point the KGB would arrest you and send you to Siberia. It's a good thing Russia doesn't exist anymore.",Michael,Season 6,6x12
34445,"[santa voice] Ho ho ho! Why pay more to sit next to old Tranny Claus over there, when you can sit on my lap. Phyllis is only ... pretending to be a man, I'm the real thing. Sit down on my lap and there will be no doubt!",Michael,Season 6,6x12

34508,"Michael, it's Phyllis. We want Phyllis as Santa.",Jim,Season 6,6x12

34510,Great!,Jim,Season 6,6x12

34516,I'll get some punch. That looks delicious. [shoves Santa hat into punch],Michael,Season 6,6x12

34524,Not a gun. [crosses gun off his 'what could it be' list],Dwight,Season 6,6x12
34526,"I don't ask for much for Christmas, I really don't. It's not like I'm begging people to buy me diamonds and ...broach pendants. 'Oh buy me something expensive or I'm gonna kill myself.'  That's not - I don't care about that. All I want to be is Santa. And, you want to take that away from me?  Fine. Go ahead.

34987,"I have come here today to talk to Mr. David Wallace about this whole thing going on with Sabre. [rings doorbell] He will know exactly what to do. He is not a big fan of me dropping by announced. But then again, who is? [loud drumming as door opens] Hey. Hi, sorry.",Michael,Season 6,6x14
34989,I hope you're not busy doing something.,Michael,Season 6,6x14
34991,You sure?,Michael,Season 6,6x14
34993,You look great too.,Michael,Season 6,6x14
34995,"Oh, yeah, that sounds good.",Michael,Season 6,6x14
34998,Hey. Wow.,Michael,Season 6,6x14
35000,Really loud.,Michael,Season 6,6x14
35001,"Wow. Oh, yummy. [David spreads marshmallow fluff on bread] You have got the life, my friend.",Michael,Season 6,6x14
35003,Can I just stay here and never go back?,Michael,Season 6,6x14
35005,"Oh, man. How much time do you have?",Michael,Season 6,6x14
35007,Yeah.,Michael,Season 6,6x14
35012,"Hi. Sorry, I was just in the neighborhood, thought I'd come by, see...",Michael,Season 6,6x14
35014,I don't know.,Michael,Season 6,6x14
35016,"There was one thing we were curious about, uh, your flexibility on things like Easter or Memorial Day, because we might want to change our days around a little bit.",Jim,Season 6,6x14
35018,"Oh, no, sorry. Just, um, we're kind of planners. But we're also flexible too, so you know what? Maybe we can just discuss it when the time comes.",Jim,Season 6,6x14
35020,Is this because Jim walked in on you going to the bathroom?,Pam,Season 6,6x14
35021,What?,Jim,Season 6,6x14
35023,Did it? It might have come up while we were waiting for you.,Jim,Season 6,6x14
35025,No.,Jim,Season 6,6x14
35026,"Maybe, because it doesn't seem to be going super well.",Pam,Season 6,6x14
35028,Nope. 'Cause we're really nice people but you don't seem to like us.,Pam,Season 6,6x14
35030,"Oh, this coming from the guy who still uses a children's toilet? Why didn't you just lock the door, man?",Jim,Season 6,6x14
35032,Anybody could have walked in.,Jim,Season 6,6x14
35034,"Sabre is changing everything. [Michael and David sitting in hot tub] Site blockers. They don't let us use cups. So I started thinking, who could handle this? Who would know what to do? David Wallace would know what to do. What should I do, David Wallace?",Michael,Season 6,6x14
35036,Exactly. What are you thinking?,Michael,Season 6,6x14
35038,It is a tough one.,Michael,Season 6,6x14
35040,Yeah. But one would be good.,Michael,Season 6,6x14
35042,Okay.,Michael,Season 6,6x14
35044,Okay.,Michael,Season 6,6x14
35046,So the kid's making the noise to pick it up.,Michael,Season 6,6x14
35048,"Oh, okay.",Michael,Season 6,6x14
35050,"No, I think it is-",Michael,Season 6,6x14
35052,Yep.,Michael,Season 6,6x14

35063,"Oh, okay.",Michael,Season 6,6x14
35065,Like it.,Michael,Season 6,6x14
35066,There are very few things that would make me not want to team up with David Wallace. And Suck It is one of 'em.,Michael,Season 6,6x14
35067,See you later. [hugs Wallace],Michael,Season 6,6x14
35069,Bye now.,Michael,Season 6,6x14
35071,Thanks for having me.,Michael,Season 6,6x14
35072,"Well, that's not the David Wallace that I remember. [reverses out of driveway, Wallace follows him] That is some sort of weird creature that lives in David Wallace's house. Oh, my god. Alright. Just get me out of here.",Michael,Season 6,6x14
35073,"Hello. [comes in carrying 4 gallons of orange juice and his water bottle] Is anybody home? Oh, thank you, Erin. Now if everyone would please ready their canteens, so I can fill them with the sweet, sweet nectar of Gabe's homeland, and then propose a toast. Here we go.",Michael,Season 6,6x14
35074,You know when people say getting fired was the best thing that ever happened to them? I feel sorry for those people. That's the best thing? Really? Ugh.,Michael,Season 6,6x14
35075,"Well, I'm not really one for making speeches.",Michael,Season 6,6x14
35077,But I feel pretty good right now. I really do. A lot better than I did earlier. Let me tell you.,Michael,Season 6,6x14
35079,No. This is my toast.  I think this whole thing with Sabre is going to work out. I have a very good feeling about it.,Michael,Season 6,6x14
35081,"Here's my toast. Orange juice is in here. And, like Saber, it is from Florida, and it is good.",Michael,Season 6,6x14
35083,Here's the toast. I'm gonna do it now. Raise your container to us and to Sabre.,Michael,Season 6,6x14
35085,"Mm. Wow. That is metallicy. Ugh. That's like drinking a battery. Ah, really gets you in the fillings, doesn't it? Okay, anyway, welcome.",Michael,Season 6,6x14
35101,"Hello Vancouver, this is Michael Scott calling from the United States of America!  I have a reservation in your fair city from February 12th to the 19th, first week of the Olympics.",Michael,Season 6,6x15
35103,Okey doke.,Michael,Season 6,6x15
35105,What?,Michael,Season 6,6x15
35106,[looking through Michael's email] I'm not seeing anything under 'confirmation.',Dwight,Season 6,6x15
35107,No.,Michael,Season 6,6x15
35108,Could it be under 'affirmation?' Cause you have thousands of those.,Dwight,Season 6,6x15
35109,No. [to hotel employee on phone] We're trying to look it up right now.,Michael,Season 6,6x15
35110,You [i]did[/i] get the e-vite to my barbeque!,Dwight,Season 6,6x15
35111,"Um, come on.",Michael,Season 6,6x15
35112,Michael...,Dwight,Season 6,6x15

35127,"Today, Jo Bennett, the CEO from Sabre, is coming to see us here for the first time. She bought us sight unseen, like a mail-order bride, so she's gotta be kinda nervous. I mean, are we ugly? Are we smart? Are we cool? Are we too cool? Do we speak English?",Michael,Season 6,6x15
35128,"[Jo Bennett enters with two humongous dogs, everyone stands to welcome her except Dwight] Why hello!",Michael,Season 6,6x15

35158,"Jo, I don't know how things work in Florida, which from your description sounds like a colorful, lawless swamp, but here it takes two men to do one job, where in Florida it might take one very strong woman to do such a job.",Michael,Season 6,6x15
35159,"Whoa, whoa.",Jim,Season 6,6x15
35160,"Whoa, whoa!",Michael,Season 6,6x15
35161,"I'll take over. Um, what we're doing here: Michael handles more of the 'big-picture' stuff, and I handle more of the day-to-day stuff, so together...",Jim,Season 6,6x15
35163,Alright.,Jim,Season 6,6x15
35165,No.,Jim,Season 6,6x15
35166,And sometimes I can hardly handle that!,Michael,Season 6,6x15
35168,I don't think so.,Jim,Season 6,6x15
35170,Forget the question...,Michael,Season 6,6x15
35172,I humbly accept the management position.,Michael,Season 6,6x15
35173,I... Why would you just say something like that?,Jim,Season 6,6x15
35174,"Because, well, Jim. Where I'm from, two types of folk: those who ain't, and those who are knee-high on a grasshopper. Which type ain't you ain't? Ya'll come back now.",Michael,Season 6,6x15
35175,Do you even know what that means?,Jim,Season 6,6x15

35178,Um...,Jim,Season 6,6x15
35201,"No, we know. Texas!",Michael,Season 6,6x15
35203,I could manage my way around that.,Michael,Season 6,6x15
35205,I will try to manage my excitement!,Michael,Season 6,6x15
35206,"I have been saying the word 'manager' a lot, so whenever Jo thinks 'manager' she thinks of me. Camel cigarettes did the same thing with Joe Camel by making him look like a penis. I can't even go near a cigarette now without thinking of a penis. And vise-versa.",Michael,Season 6,6x15
35208,"[Jo leaves] I, uh...",Dwight,Season 6,6x15
35211,"So, check this out. According to the handbook, you could make more money as a salesman than as a manager. They have all these incentive programs. I ran your numbers from last year.",Pam,Season 6,6x15
35212,This is way more than I make now.,Jim,Season 6,6x15
35213,"I don't think I'm gonna miss being manager. You know how some people say they're not in it for the money? Well, with all due respect to this job, I think I'm definitely in it for the money. And quite honestly, the women.",Jim,Season 6,6x15
35214,"Hey, you got a second?",Jim,Season 6,6x15
35215,Sure. You here to tell me that you think I would be a better manager and that you are sorry for being such a jerk?,Michael,Season 6,6x15
35216,"Actually, yeah.",Jim,Season 6,6x15
35217,What?,Michael,Season 6,6x15
35218,Exactly that. I think that you absolutely deserve the manager position more than I do.,Jim,Season 6,6x15
35219,What? Really?,Michael,Season 6,6x15
35220,Yeah!,Jim,Season 6,6x15
35221,Wow!,Michael,Season 6,6x15
35222,"La la la, hello Oscar!",Michael,Season 6,6x15
35224,What are you reading?,Michael,Season 6,6x15
35226,"Oh, that is my favorite ocean! I love it! I am so happy right now. No! I can't keep it a secret any longer. Jim is stepping down to salesman, I am going to be the sole manager once again.",Michael,Season 6,6x15
35228,"Why, is there an untapped gay market?",Michael,Season 6,6x15
35230,...Where did you get that information.,Michael,Season 6,6x15
35232,Manuel who?,Michael,Season 6,6x15

35236,Okay.,Michael,Season 6,6x15
35238,"Really? Aw, that is so sweet of you! But, I cannot accept, because I have been thinking about it, and I think I wanna go back to sales.",Michael,Season 6,6x15
35240,Really.,Jim,Season 6,6x15
35241,"Yeah. You can take the man out of the salesman, but you can't take the sales out of salesman.",Michael,Season 6,6x15
35243,"No, I really, really think Michael is better at being manager for so many reasons.",Jim,Season 6,6x15
35244,"No, I think I would be bad. I would sleep in my office, and I would sexually harass people.",Michael,Season 6,6x15
35245,Why would you do that?,Jim,Season 6,6x15
35246,I'm turning myself in right now!,Michael,Season 6,6x15
35248,Thank you.,Michael,Season 6,6x15
35250,"Great! That's great. Congratulations. Have fun signing my commission checks, boss.",Michael,Season 6,6x15

35254,You're twenty minutes late!,Dwight,Season 6,6x15
35256,Just admit you lost track of time.,Dwight,Season 6,6x15
35257,Ryan and I have been meeting up to work on our diabolical plot against Jim. Ryan is always late for our meetings. I wish I had a lair.,Dwight,Season 6,6x15
35259,Of course I seesaw. Mose and I seesaw all the time.,Dwight,Season 6,6x15
35261,"Oh, yeah. Great film. Almost as fun as going on a seesaw.",Dwight,Season 6,6x15
35263,I like where you're going with this. Continue.,Dwight,Season 6,6x15
35265,I have an old barn!,Dwight,Season 6,6x15
35267,"It's kinda smelly, but that might be a plus! And then what?",Dwight,Season 6,6x15
35269,"Okay, that's your idea? Exactly like in the movie!? That is the most idiotic thing I have ever heard in my life!",Dwight,Season 6,6x15
35271,He's supposed to cut his leg off? Think!,Dwight,Season 6,6x15
35273,Think!,Dwight,Season 6,6x15
35276,How is that possible?,Michael,Season 6,6x15
35278,"No excuses Erin, come on! Make it happen.",Michael,Season 6,6x15
35280,"Oh, yeah. Fine, fine. Leave it here. I have to make some sales anyway. Who should I call with my magic sales fingers? [Michael's phone rings] Michael Scott, head of sales.",Michael,Season 6,6x15

35282,The new IT guy. Nick.,Dwight,Season 6,6x15
35284,"I think he is the key. He's very trusting, he's looking for friends, he has been given an awesome amount of power, and does not know how to wield it.",Dwight,Season 6,6x15
35286,"Why don't you just let me handle the Tolkien references, okay dumb jock?",Dwight,Season 6,6x15
35288,Smeagol was corrupted and became Gollum.,Dwight,Season 6,6x15
35289,I might start a diabolical plot against him after this one.,Dwight,Season 6,6x15
35291,What is that?,Jim,Season 6,6x15
35293,"Oh. I'm fine. Thank you, though.",Jim,Season 6,6x15
35295,Why would I wanna do that?,Jim,Season 6,6x15
35297,"For now, I'm just gonna go back to work here...",Jim,Season 6,6x15
35299,Yeah. Thank you.,Jim,Season 6,6x15
35301,"[on phone] It will be a pleasure doing business with you. Thanks, bye. [hangs up phone, blows train whistle] I just got a new account for the gentleman's club in Carbondale. It is called 'Curves.' I went by there the other day, saw some of the women walking in. Not really my cup of tea. Actually, Kevin, you might like it!",Michael,Season 6,6x15
35303,"You know, we really don't announce out loud our sales that much.",Dwight,Season 6,6x15
35304,Why not? It's part of the sales experience.,Michael,Season 6,6x15
35305,It's not really 1992 anymore.,Dwight,Season 6,6x15
35306,"Well, okay...",Michael,Season 6,6x15
35314,"Ho-ho. There he is, the IT guy. So you discovered the break room.",Dwight,Season 6,6x15
35316,"I imagine one of the best things about being an IT guy is, you get to know everyone's computer passwords.",Dwight,Season 6,6x15
35318,"Listen, I know you have to say that, but we got a little problem here. There is an employee named Jim Halpert, and he is doing some terrible things, okay? He is molesting people via the internet. And we need to stop him.",Dwight,Season 6,6x15
35320,"No, the cops called us. So I'm gonna need you to give me the password to Jim Halpert's computer.",Dwight,Season 6,6x15
35325,What is that smell? Do you smell that? What is that? Like a sulfur deposit under here?,Michael,Season 6,6x15
35326,"Michael, stop.",Pam,Season 6,6x15
35327,"No, I'm serious, we don't have to put up... Is it the dogs?",Michael,Season 6,6x15
35328,Michael...,Pam,Season 6,6x15

35331,"No, this is geological.",Michael,Season 6,6x15
35333,Are you kidding me?,Michael,Season 6,6x15
35335,And you guys are okay with this?,Michael,Season 6,6x15
35336,"She sent an email, so.",Dwight,Season 6,6x15

35349,Hey.,Michael,Season 6,6x15
35350,Hey.,Jim,Season 6,6x15

35352,"Well, the grass is always greener.",Jim,Season 6,6x15
35353,Yeah. Except there's no grass out there. It's just a farty dirt patch.,Michael,Season 6,6x15
35354,"Well, it's what you wanted.",Jim,Season 6,6x15
35355,I really need my job back. We made a terrible mistake here.,Michael,Season 6,6x15

35360,That's it. I think we should do it the Lethal Weapon way.,Jim,Season 6,6x15
35362,What? What I'm saying...,Michael,Season 6,6x15
35363,"Michael's saying he's better at being manager, and I agree, cause he's a better people person, weirdly.",Jim,Season 6,6x15
35364,"And weirdly I'm a good dog person, right guys? [dogs go to him] See? They love me.",Michael,Season 6,6x15
35366,Alright.,Jim,Season 6,6x15
35367,Alright!,Michael,Season 6,6x15

35387,[entering elevator with Ryan] I can't help but think that something we did made this possible.,Dwight,Season 6,6x15
35389,"Oh temp, I like that. I'm going to engrave that into a piece of wood. Care to celebrate with a drink?",Dwight,Season 6,6x15
35391,Because! Martini bars are pretentious. No thank you.,Dwight,Season 6,6x15
35393,"It is not 'farm boy swill,' I will show you. It is beet Vodka and it is delicious.",Dwight,Season 6,6x15
35395,"[on the phone with a client] I just wanted to check and see if there's anything you needed before I went on my maternity leave...  Yeah, I'm pregnant...  Great, well, I'll write up the order.  Okay, thanks.",Pam,Season 6,6x16
35396,Wait a minute!  You can't do that.  You cannot exploit your baby for sales.,Dwight,Season 6,6x16
35397,"[on the phone] Hey, did I tell you we were going to have a baby?  Oh, thank you very much.  I'm excited.  Oh, definitely.",Jim,Season 6,6x16
35398,"No, no!  You need to come by your sales honorably!",Dwight,Season 6,6x16

35400,"[on the phone with a client]  Hey there.  Dwight Schrute here.  Listen, uh, would you be interested in restocking on paper? ...  Yeah, I could sure use the money.

35401,"I need a baby.  I'll never outsell Jim and Pam without one.  Also, I've been noticing a gaping hole in my life.  Sometimes I wake up cradling a gourd.",Dwight,Season 6,6x16
35402,"Kevin, you're such a gourmand.",Pam,Season 6,6x16
35404,Hmm.,Pam,Season 6,6x16
35407,"Mmmm, that sounds great.  What are you thinking?",Pam,Season 6,6x16
35410,"No, no.  I still have time.",Pam,Season 6,6x16
35411,"I'm having contractions, but they're irregular and far apart.  So I'm not really in labor, I'm near labor.",Pam,Season 6,6x16
35412,"Yeah, we're slow-playing it because of our stupid HMO.",Jim,Season 6,6x16
35413,"If we check in after midnight, I get an extra day to recuperate surrounded by doctors.",Pam,Season 6,6x16
35414,"Not to mention the extra night's sleep in the hospital will be very nice because once we bring the baby home, if it's crying all night, one of us is going to have to take care of it.  And I do not plan on helping unless it's a boy.",Jim,Season 6,6x16
35415,I cannot wait for that joke to be over.,Pam,Season 6,6x16
35416,Ooh.,Pam,Season 6,6x16
35417,"Oh, oh, oh!  Contraption!  She's contrapting!  Okay, you know what?  I think I should drive you guys to the hospital, and here is why.  I am a licensed, classy driver in the state of Pennsylvania.  I gassed up the car...",Michael,Season 6,6x16

35420,"Michael, you shouldn't have done that.",Jim,Season 6,6x16
35421,"Happy to do it.  Also, I did a heck of a job baby-proofing this office.",Michael,Season 6,6x16
35422,"You know the baby's not going to live here, right?",Pam,Season 6,6x16
35423,"Well, the baby was conceived here, so might as well live here a little bit, too.",Michael,Season 6,6x16
35424,"Hmm, that logic's air-tight, but unfortunately it wasn't conceived here.  Burning man, port-o-potty.",Jim,Season 6,6x16
35425,"Oh, yuck!  TMI!  How was it?  I don't want to know.  Tell me later.  Let's go!  Let's go!  Hospital!",Michael,Season 6,6x16
35426,"Okay, okay, we're not going to the hospital.  We are waiting until midnight.",Pam,Season 6,6x16

35447,Five minutes apart.,Pam,Season 6,6x16

35757,"Yesterday, I was dispatched to Jim and Pam's house to find Pam's iPod.  I searched everywhere, but I didn't find it.  What I did find, was mold, and lots of it.  So, I did what anyone would do.  Read a book, had a bath, I got a good night's sleep, and I made plans to eradicate it.  I also made plans to ask Jim where he bought his marvelous sheets...  Time to get to work [he begins to destroy the kitchen with a sledgehammer].",Dwight,Season 6,6x16
35758,"There she sat.  Her name was Pam.  She was a receptionist.  She was engaged to an animal.  There sat Jim.  He was a gawky, tall salesman.  The odds of them getting together were insur-mountain-able.  I made a family!  I got these two together, and I made a family.",Michael,Season 6,6x16

35773,Remember yesterday when we were terrified of being parents?,Pam,Season 6,6x16

35794,Doesn't feel right.,Pam,Season 6,6x16
35795,"Well, you're pushing the milk out, right?",Jim,Season 6,6x16
35796,How does one do that?,Pam,Season 6,6x16
35797,Wasn't it...  It's kinda like a...  Like that.,Jim,Season 6,6x16

35806,No.  I read in the book about nipple confusion.,Pam,Season 6,6x16

35810,Alright.,Jim,Season 6,6x16
35812,It's going to be alright.,Jim,Season 6,6x16
35813,Maybe it'll be good because then she can like socialize with the other babies.,Pam,Season 6,6x16
35814,"Ha ha.  No, yeah, that will be good.",Jim,Season 6,6x16

35831,Bye.,Michael,Season 6,6x16
35833,Okay.  This is going to kill Kevin.,Michael,Season 6,6x16

35837,"No, Kevin doesn't have an elephant heart.  But he is very sensitive.  And it won't kill Erin just to go and have lunch with him in the break room like I promised him...  I bet his heart is enlarged, though.",Michael,Season 6,6x16
35839,Just don't let him sit on you...  I'm kidding.  You'll have fun.  It'll be good.  It'll be good.  There he is.  Go to him.,Michael,Season 6,6x16

35898,"[on the phone]  Hey, what's up, kid?",Dwight,Season 6,6x16

36411,"Ahh, these aren't leads. What are they?",Jim,Season 6,6x18
36412,"Oh, right, those are clues. And within each clue is a lesson. You learn a lesson, and then you find a lead. The leads are scattered all over the industrial park. I am trying to make your kids respect you. Because a father needs to respect his boss, and kids don't respect the father who doesn't respect the boss. Do you understand that line of logic?",Michael,Season 6,6x18

36478,"Well, that's not the way it's going t sound. Here's what we're going to do. We'll go to the dump, we'll look around, then we'll all go out and get pizza, maybe catch a movie, late-night drink, some more pizza, call it a night. What do you -",Michael,Season 6,6x18
36480,Really?,Michael,Season 6,6x18

37078,It's not sterile!,Pam,Season 6,6x20
37091,Jim does a really good one. Do yours.,Pam,Season 6,6x20
37092,"Oh, guys. I really refuse to participate. 'Michael, can I have an advance on my paycheck because a Mrs. Fields Cookie just opened up at the mall.'",Jim,Season 6,6x20
37094,"Sorry, Gabe, but that show hasn't been on in many cookies.'",Jim,Season 6,6x20
37097,"You know what, I think we can all agree that Angela's not so great, so..",Michael,Season 6,6x20
37099,No. No. No.,Michael,Season 6,6x20
37101,Stop talking.,Michael,Season 6,6x20
37104,Oh God.,Michael,Season 6,6x20
37109,"No, no never.",Pam,Season 6,6x20
37111,Yeah pretty much.,Dwight,Season 6,6x20
37117,"[imitating Cookie Monster] 'Hey, Erin, You look delicious. I mean, beautiful.'",Pam,Season 6,6x20
37119,"What? What do you mean, suspend me?",Pam,Season 6,6x20
37120,I think you need to go a little easy. You can't just suspend someone form work.,Jim,Season 6,6x20
37122,"Wait, What? I was just slow-clapping your no-nonsense decision-making.",Dwight,Season 6,6x20
37126,"Andy, she's not the easiest person in the world to have a conversation with. All right? And besides, who doesn't tell their girlfriend that they were engaged to someone who works four feet away from them? That's like.. that's like Mr. and Mrs. Smith crap.",Michael,Season 6,6x20
37128,"You know what, I resent the implication that I would keep that secret. Everyone here knows that I can't and won't keep a secret.",Michael,Season 6,6x20
37138,Hey. You know I was engaged before Jim.,Pam,Season 6,6x20
37140,Yeah. And he worked here too.,Pam,Season 6,6x20
37142,"No, no it wasn't Andy. It wasn't. It doesn't matter. It's not about who you've been with. It's about who you end up with. Sometimes the heart doesn't know what it wants until it finds what it wants.",Pam,Season 6,6x20
37144,Thank you. [kisses Jim on the cheek],Pam,Season 6,6x20
37146,[answers phone] Hey Toby.,Pam,Season 6,6x20
37148,Very interesting.,Pam,Season 6,6x20
37150,[Gabe walks in] Thanks Toby.,Pam,Season 6,6x20
37152,I don't think an apology is enough. I really think the only way for me to learn my lesson is to take my suspension.,Pam,Season 6,6x20
37153,"And I got to take this bad attitude, and I got to go home, and I got to adjust it. And I hope the suspension does that.",Jim,Season 6,6x20
37154,"[gets up and walks towards Gabe] Prideful idiots. Watch how it's done. [Jim and Pam get their things together and start to leave] Gabriel, I apologize.",Dwight,Season 6,6x20
37156,[gets on one knee] I kneel before you.,Dwight,Season 6,6x20
37158,Humbly taking your hand upon which I kiss to show my contrition.,Dwight,Season 6,6x20
37174,What was that? Are you kidding me? Was that an impression?,Dwight,Season 6,6x20
37178,I have to go back to the zoo to the stick insect exhibit.',Dwight,Season 6,6x20
37182,Erin?,Michael,Season 6,6x20
37184,"No, no, I was just watching Cookie Monster. It finally downloaded. Mind if I sit down?",Michael,Season 6,6x20
37186,Oh. Yep. I'm sorry about that. I feel... I'm sorry I caused that thing.,Michael,Season 6,6x20
37188,"Well, yeah, yes. But I still feel sorry. You know what, I wouldn't worry about Angela. She doesn't hold a candle to you, Erin. She's old enough to be your mom for one thing. And she's, like, three feet tall. And she wears pioneer women clothing. And I don't think she's ever pooped in her life. And Andy, you know, come on. Andy, his butt looks big in those khakis.",Michael,Season 6,6x20
37190,You said butt.,Michael,Season 6,6x20
37192,"Ahh! You said it! You know who you would love? Oh, this guy in my neighborhood, Tom Dizemore. This is him: 'Hey! Hey Scott!'",Michael,Season 6,6x20
37197,"Yeah, I mean, the Count has a very distinct voice.",Jim,Season 6,6x20
37198,Yeah. 'I vant to count to ten'.,Pam,Season 6,6x20
37202,That would have been funny.,Pam,Season 6,6x20
37204,"[walking up] Oh, oh, I was just watching that. Did you do that, man? 'Oscar. I am the Count.' Nailed him. Nailed him. [Gives Kevin a fist pump] Good work Cookie Monster.",Michael,Season 6,6x20
37206,"Buenos dias, Erin.",Michael,Season 6,6x21
37208,"No, no, no, no. Solamente en espanol, por favor.",Michael,Season 6,6x21
37209,"I believe that every man, woman, and child in this country should learn how to speak Spanish. They are our neighbors to the South, and this would be a healing thing for... for all of North America. And... I am going on vacation next week to Cancun.",Michael,Season 6,6x21
37210,"Buenos dias, Jaime.",Michael,Season 6,6x21
37211,"Buenos dias, Miguel. Como estas? Bien? Claro que si! Yo estoy fantastico. Que pasa?",Jim,Season 6,6x21
37212,"Ha ha! Buenos dias, Dwight!",Michael,Season 6,6x21
37213,"Guten tag, Herr Michael.",Dwight,Season 6,6x21
37214,"I don't understand why Michael is wasting his time with Spanish. I have it on very good authority that within 20 years, everyone will be speaking German. Or a Chinese-German hybrid.",Dwight,Season 6,6x21
37215,La telefona.,Michael,Season 6,6x21
37219,"[clears throat] Oh. Eso es lo que dice, el!",Michael,Season 6,6x21
37221,"Damn it. [knock on door] Ah, Angelo.",Michael,Season 6,6x21
37223,Yo soy Cancun.,Michael,Season 6,6x21
37225,"All right, so I'll finish up on bulk pricing, and then you go into delivery guarantee.",Jim,Season 6,6x21
37226,"You know, maybe there's an opportunity for a joke there, like, um... like, [vaudeville delivery] 'I just delivered a baby. They didn't offer me a guarantee.'",Pam,Season 6,6x21
37227,"Yeah, or maybe we don't even need that.",Jim,Season 6,6x21
37228,Can you smell the power of the Halperts? Power couple.,Michael,Season 6,6x21
37229,"You know what? I should be getting this client, Michael. My numbers are better than either of theirs.",Dwight,Season 6,6x21
37230,I went with the people I thought would put the best face on the company.,Michael,Season 6,6x21
37231,"If you want people to put the best face on something, why would you get two people who probably never cut the face off of anything in their lives?",Dwight,Season 6,6x21
37232,[whispers] That's a good point.,Jim,Season 6,6x21
37233,This is our first joint sales pitch. I think we're gonna work really well together.,Pam,Season 6,6x21
37234,Yeah I think we have complimentary strengths. We understand each other.,Jim,Season 6,6x21
37235,"We have good give and take. [vaudeville delivery] I give, he takes.",Pam,Season 6,6x21
37236,[whispering] I don't even know who you are anymore.,Jim,Season 6,6x21

37239,"Oh, hey, Miss Newton. Hi, I'm Jim.",Jim,Season 6,6x21
37241,How are you?,Jim,Season 6,6x21
37242,Did somebody order a hooker over here?,Michael,Season 6,6x21
37244,Hi. How are you?,Michael,Season 6,6x21
37245,"There's this woman I met a few weeks ago. Her name is Donna, the manager of Sid & Dexter's and, right now, we're in the midst of a passionate love affair. Um, no. But she is coming by today. Maybe to buy some printers, so...",Michael,Season 6,6x21
37246,"Right here, we have the wonder twins, Jim and Pam Halpert. They will be assisting you today.",Michael,Season 6,6x21
37248,"Oh, no we're actually married. We're not brother and sister.",Pam,Season 6,6x21
37250,All right.,Jim,Season 6,6x21
37253,"[explaining PowerPoint to Donna] So, yes, laser printers are more expensive. But they cost less to operate [knocking] So it's a tradeoff.",Jim,Season 6,6x21
37254,[barges in] Hi.,Michael,Season 6,6x21
37255,Hold on one second.,Jim,Season 6,6x21
37256,"Sorry to interrupt. Sorry to interrupt. Do you, Donna, by any chance shop at Victoria's Secret?",Michael,Season 6,6x21
37257,What?,Jim,Season 6,6x21
37258,Because I keep getting these magazines sent to me via the address of the woman who used to live in my condo before me.,Michael,Season 6,6x21
37259,None of this is time sensitive.,Jim,Season 6,6x21
37260,"Uh, yes, uh, the sale is on now through May.",Michael,Season 6,6x21
37262,"Okay, I have more of them.",Michael,Season 6,6x21
37265,What is this?,Dwight,Season 6,6x21
37267,"It doesn't just sound a'ight, it sounds amazing.",Dwight,Season 6,6x21
37269,How do I apply?,Dwight,Season 6,6x21
37271,"Uh, glasses wearers. Cholera survivors. Geniuses. Non-organic family farmers. The list goes on and on. You want me to keep going?",Dwight,Season 6,6x21
37273,Come here. Come here.,Dwight,Season 6,6x21
37275,"Ten seconds ago, this guy was driving a forklift. Okay? Now all off a sudden he's Cinderella of the office. What are you guys thinking?",Dwight,Season 6,6x21
37278,"One minority from this branch is going to get into this program. Who would I refer? Hmm... the competent, hardworking one who does things his own way, or the malleable simpleton who can be bought for a few fashion magazines?",Dwight,Season 6,6x21
37280,"Oh, man. White people, right?",Dwight,Season 6,6x21
37282,"Well, you can kinda tell from the voice.",Dwight,Season 6,6x21
37284,"I bet you get pulled over by the cops a lot, just because of your race.",Dwight,Season 6,6x21
37286,I think you should consider applying for the executive minority training program.,Dwight,Season 6,6x21
37288,"I know, 'cause you have no role models. How many Indian CEO's can you think of?",Dwight,Season 6,6x21
37290,You could be the Indian Bill Gates. You could be the Indian Ted Turner.,Dwight,Season 6,6x21
37292,That's not... she's... okay. Yes.,Dwight,Season 6,6x21
37293,"I took the liberty to scan a few things earlier, and I want to show you... there we go! [Michael's picture pops up on the PowerPoint screen] Whoa, look at those vivid colors. Look at my eyes. Those are Shrek-green eyes. That is me again. I think this displays the crisp, dazzling white.",Michael,Season 6,6x21
37295,"And that would be a display [image from a catalog of a man wearing only white boxers pops up] of the crisp, gorgeous black.",Michael,Season 6,6x21
37297,"It's subtle. That's how it works. I show her an image that turns her on. 	And then she looks at me, then back at me, then back at the image. Soon, she doesn't know what is me, what is the image. She just knows that she's turned on.",Michael,Season 6,6x21
37298,This is a place that I like to go to be alone with my thoughts. I've never taken anybody there before.,Michael,Season 6,6x21
37300,Ryan.,Michael,Season 6,6x21
37302,And that's it. That's me. That's who I am.,Michael,Season 6,6x21
37304,"Oh, thanks. [softly] You're not bad, either.",Michael,Season 6,6x21
37306,Hmm.,Michael,Season 6,6x21
37308,Jim! Could you come in here for a sec? What was that printer we were looking at?,Michael,Season 6,6x21
37309,"[in his office] You didn't see it, Pam. She was giving me all sorts of signals that she wanted me to make a move. Shortbread?",Michael,Season 6,6x21
37310,No.,Jim,Season 6,6x21
37311,I'll have one.,Pam,Season 6,6x21
37312,"Well, maybe you shouldn't try to kiss people at work.",Jim,Season 6,6x21
37313,"Oh really, Jim? What about Pam? And you did a heck of a lot more than kiss. Maybe this could be my Pam.",Michael,Season 6,6x21
37314,"Okay. Well, all that is irrelevant.",Jim,Season 6,6x21
37315,"Maybe Michael has a point. I mean, if she was really that upset, she wouldn't still be here.",Pam,Season 6,6x21
37317,"Look, I know that I screwed up in there. I know that I probably messed up your sale. I just want to go in and fix it.",Michael,Season 6,6x21
37318,What if I back out and you finish the pitch with Jim?,Pam,Season 6,6x21
37319,What?,Jim,Season 6,6x21
37320,What was that?,Jim,Season 6,6x21
37321,Just let him flirt with her. People meet each other all sorts of ways.,Pam,Season 6,6x21
37322,"Pam, you know he's not gonna get anywhere, and he's gonna blow our sale.",Jim,Season 6,6x21
37323,Who cares? [Michael peeking at them through his office window] It's not that huge a sale.,Pam,Season 6,6x21
37324,"Hey, the Schwab guy told us to treat every sale like it was a huge sale.",Jim,Season 6,6x21
37325,"Don't act like you understood anything that guy said. [pat's Jim's arm] Good luck, wingman. [salutes]",Pam,Season 6,6x21
37326,How as being a minority affected you?,Dwight,Season 6,6x21
37328,"Oh, good, and you resent this because...",Dwight,Season 6,6x21
37330,"Oh, no, no. That's not dorky. [Dwight wears his phone like that] Look, it's easily accessible. Boom, like this. 911, hello. Scranton Strangler's in the house. Inside the house.",Dwight,Season 6,6x21
37337,Maybe she's just pushing her breasts together to make them look bigger.,Pam,Season 6,6x21
37340,"Uh, for that printer, yes. Unfortunately we don't have a lot of flexibility.",Jim,Season 6,6x21
37342,Yeah. [chuckles],Jim,Season 6,6x21
37343,"So maybe we could find a little wiggle room, right?",Michael,Season 6,6x21
37344,What's that?,Jim,Season 6,6x21
37345,Maybe wee find some wiggle room?,Michael,Season 6,6x21
37346,I don't... I don't think so.,Jim,Season 6,6x21
37347,I think we could. [Donna giggles],Michael,Season 6,6x21
37349,"Okay, well sometimes... sometimes it makes financial sense to lose money, right? Like for tax purposes.",Michael,Season 6,6x21
37351,Why don't you run them again?,Michael,Season 6,6x21
37352,What if she's just flirting with you to get a better price?,Jim,Season 6,6x21
37353,"If she is, it's working.",Michael,Season 6,6x21
37355,She does not like him.,Jim,Season 6,6x21
37356,You can flirt with someone to get what you want and also be attracted to them. How do you think we got together?,Pam,Season 6,6x21
37357,cause I stopped by your desk like 15 times a day.,Jim,Season 6,6x21
37358,I was after your money.,Pam,Season 6,6x21
37359,"Well, the joke was on you.",Jim,Season 6,6x21
37360,"Yes, it was.",Pam,Season 6,6x21
37363,Hey... what are you guys doing?,Dwight,Season 6,6x21
37367,"You know, we really should keep practicing for this interview.",Dwight,Season 6,6x21
37369,Ryan? What does he know?,Dwight,Season 6,6x21
37372,We?',Dwight,Season 6,6x21
37375,"Kelly will be even worse than Darryl. If you'd have told me this morning that today I'd be creating a monster capable f my own destruction, I 'd have thought you were referring to the bull Mose and I are trying to reanimate.",Dwight,Season 6,6x21
37376,So corporate approval of this contract is contingent upon buyer and seller...,Michael,Season 6,6x21
37378,Operating blahdy blahdy blah. Boilerplate. Pound of fish. [Donna laughing] Just kidding. Do you like mints?,Michael,Season 6,6x21
37380,I carry mints with me sometimes. You ever tried those?,Michael,Season 6,6x21
37382,They're good [Donna grabs mint],Michael,Season 6,6x21
37384,Sure.,Michael,Season 6,6x21
37386,I can't stop myself from kissing her.,Michael,Season 6,6x21
37390,"Okay, guys, guys, guys. Just tell me it's not totally insane to try one more time.",Michael,Season 6,6x21
37391,It is totally insane.,Jim,Season 6,6x21
37393,Okay. What do you think?,Michael,Season 6,6x21
37395,Andy?,Michael,Season 6,6x21
37397,"Okay, some for, some against.",Michael,Season 6,6x21

37402,"Um... I think it's really, really unlikely.",Pam,Season 6,6x21
37403,Okay.,Jim,Season 6,6x21
37404,Really unlikely. But I can't say that it's impossible.,Pam,Season 6,6x21
37405,What?,Jim,Season 6,6x21
37406,"I'm not saying she's in love with him. But she could have left a while ago. Most printer sales are done over the phone, Ms. Boob shirt.",Pam,Season 6,6x21
37407,I'm going with Pam's group.,Michael,Season 6,6x21
37408,Wait.,Jim,Season 6,6x21

37414,No.,Jim,Season 6,6x21
37415,"What sort of movie would Rudy have been if he had just stopped, given up, after two rejections? Would have been a lot shorter. Probably been a lot funnier. But it would have ultimately been a disappointment. I still would have seen it, but that's not... the point.",Michael,Season 6,6x21
37416,Kelly is disqualified!,Dwight,Season 6,6x21
37418,"You said the program is not open to Caucasians. Well... anthropologically, she is Indian. Indians migrated from the caucuses region of Europe. Therefore, technically, she is Caucasian. You're welcome, America.",Dwight,Season 6,6x21
37420,"Well, obviously, she is brownish. But come on, I mean, Darryl is far more ethnic.",Dwight,Season 6,6x21
37423,Kelly is the only applicant.,Dwight,Season 6,6x21

37443,Thank you so much.,Michael,Season 6,6x21
37445,Mmm. [Donna giggles],Michael,Season 6,6x21
37447,"[follows her out of office] Ahem. So, um... okay, if you have... if there's any other questions that you have...",Michael,Season 6,6x21

37477,"Hey, Michael. [Michael is sitting on couch outside his office] How you doing?",Pam,Season 6,6x21
37478,I don't know. I don't know. Can't really trust my feelings anymore.,Michael,Season 6,6x21
37479,"You know what, Michael? For what it's worth... I was wrong, too. I thought she was interested in you.",Pam,Season 6,6x21
37480,She suckered you too.,Michael,Season 6,6x21
37481,Mm-hmm.,Pam,Season 6,6x21
37482,Was it the cleavage?,Michael,Season 6,6x21
37483,"Yeah, and the shoulder cutouts.",Pam,Season 6,6x21
37484,Yep.,Michael,Season 6,6x21
37488,God. She left this here?,Michael,Season 6,6x21
37490,Okay. Maybe she wants me to return this to her at her work.,Michael,Season 6,6x21
37491,What?,Jim,Season 6,6x21
37493,Yeah. This could be a signal. People don't just take barrettes off.,Michael,Season 6,6x21

37496,[hold up barrette] Well...,Michael,Season 6,6x21

37529,"Really?! Oh, that's great. That's such good news. I did it! [all look at him] I kissed. We kissed.",Michael,Season 6,6x21
37532,"No, I'm serious. It... this happened. I went down to the parking lot and I was... I returned her barrette [holds up barrette] We ki... We did. Okay. We did. We did.",Michael,Season 6,6x21
37533,You know what? It doesn't matter. Because I know it happened. And that is all that counts. [shouts] I did do it!,Michael,Season 6,6x21
37534,Stop it!,Dwight,Season 6,6x22
37535,Stop what?,Jim,Season 6,6x22
37536,"You're talking about me in Morse Code. Well, you know what? Joke's on you 'cause I know Morse Code. Ha!",Dwight,Season 6,6x22
37537,"[chuckles] Yeah. That's what we're doing. In our very limited free time and with our very limited budget, we went and got a nanny and then we went out and took a class on a very outmoded and very unnecessary form of communication just so we could talk about you in front of you.",Jim,Season 6,6x22
37538,Yup. That's exactly what we did.,Jim,Season 6,6x22
37539,"It all started when Dwight was tapping his foot against the leg of his desk. When I asked him to stop, he said, 'I will when you lose the baby weight.'",Pam,Season 6,6x22
37540,Very well. I must have imagined it. I apologize. [Pam clacking her stapler and Jim responding with tapping his keyboard rhythmically] Detonator. Detonator where? Michael!,Dwight,Season 6,6x22
37541,Jim. Are you clicking a detonator?,Michael,Season 6,6x22
37542,It's a pen.,Jim,Season 6,6x22
37543,"Michael, come on.",Dwight,Season 6,6x22
37544,"Get back to work, Dwight. Please.",Michael,Season 6,6x22
37545,Fine. [clears throat] Hey. Tap away. [Dwight puts noise-cancelling headphones on and Pam and Jim begin to blink rhythmically],Dwight,Season 6,6x22
37546,"Ooh! Things with Donna are so... oh-ho-ho! They're going great. I, uh... we're just clicking on every level. Emotionally and sexually and... orally and I am not used to relationships going this well. I'm actually having trouble focusing on my job. And I like it!",Michael,Season 6,6x22
37547,"Who enjoys the weekends? [all raise hands] Of course. Now the weekend is always great if you have someone, which I do. I have Donna. She is hot. She has a Pilates butt. But we need to find something to do this weekend beside have sex. Did I say that? Yes, I did. [all nod] And the reason you are here is that I need ideas for things that Donna and I could do on the weekend.  So just shout it out.",Michael,Season 6,6x22
37549,Okay.,Michael,Season 6,6x22
37551,"Okay, you get out of here, big dog. [high-fives Stanley] Ah, no, no, no, no. You guys sit down. I need ideas.",Michael,Season 6,6x22
37552,Stanley got to go.,Pam,Season 6,6x22
37553,"Yeah, well, Stanley doesn't help with anything. Come on. Shout 'em out, shout 'em out.",Michael,Season 6,6x22
37555,Oh!,Michael,Season 6,6x22
37557,That's fun.,Michael,Season 6,6x22
37558,Eel fishing.,Dwight,Season 6,6x22
37559,All right.,Michael,Season 6,6x22
37562,"We actually went to the Poconos last Tuesday. We headed up there, we went to a little Chinese bistro, um, P.F. Chang's.",Michael,Season 6,6x22
37564,"Because when your super-hot girlfriend says, 'I wanna go to Mount Pocono,' you go to Mount Pocono and you do her. And we screwed. Whoops. TMI.",Michael,Season 6,6x22
37566,"You know what, Kelly? This is the real world. Not The Real World: Scranton. Oh my God, this is super weird. When Ryan had two girlfriends, he used to take me to some diner in Hazelton just so the other girl wouldn't see.",Michael,Season 6,6x22
37568,You guys think Donna's cheating on me?,Michael,Season 6,6x22
37569,"No, Michael, no.",Pam,Season 6,6x22
37570,Are you nuts?,Dwight,Season 6,6x22
37571,You had a nice meal with your girlfriend in a lovely place...,Pam,Season 6,6x22
37572,"... and... we had sex, too.",Michael,Season 6,6x22
37573,That is right. Don't make any more of it.,Pam,Season 6,6x22
37574,How?,Michael,Season 6,6x22
37575,How what?,Pam,Season 6,6x22
37576,How do I not make any more of it?,Michael,Season 6,6x22
37577,You could start by concluding this meeting.,Pam,Season 6,6x22
37578,"All right.  [all stand up to leave] And she won't say, 'I love you.'",Michael,Season 6,6x22
37579,"Oh, no.",Dwight,Season 6,6x22
37581,Nine dates. I said it on the second date.,Michael,Season 6,6x22
37586,"Yeah, she does all that.",Michael,Season 6,6x22
37588,"No, no...",Michael,Season 6,6x22
37589,"Michael, do not let your imagination run amok.",Pam,Season 6,6x22
37590,Run what?,Michael,Season 6,6x22
37591,"Amok. It means, don't let your imagination run out of control.",Pam,Season 6,6x22
37592,"Why didn't you just say that, Pam?",Michael,Season 6,6x22
37593,"Michael, do not let your imagination run out of control.",Pam,Season 6,6x22
37594,"Well, that's easy for you to say. You have a bad imagination. It's stupid. I live in a fantasy world.",Michael,Season 6,6x22
37595,You do?,Jim,Season 6,6x22
37596,"Yes, Jim, I do. And I can't stay in a relationship that is full of lies and deceit.",Michael,Season 6,6x22
37597,But you didn't believe any of this was true five minutes ago.,Jim,Season 6,6x22
37598,That's what makes it so wrong.,Michael,Season 6,6x22
37599,"Ever since I found out that Donna might be cheating on me, I have not eaten or slept. This not knowing, that's what's killing me.",Michael,Season 6,6x22
37600,"Oh, God, that tickles. What did...",Dwight,Season 6,6x22
37601,[whispers] I want someone to follow Donna. I want her tailed. I need the name of a good private investigator.,Michael,Season 6,6x22
37602,I think I've got one for you. [hands Michael a business card],Dwight,Season 6,6x22
37603,This is you. How much do you charge?,Michael,Season 6,6x22
37604,"$100 a day, plus expenses.",Dwight,Season 6,6x22
37605,I'll give you $50. Money's no object.,Michael,Season 6,6x22
37606,I'm just gonna warn you... and I say this to all my clients... you might not like what I find.,Dwight,Season 6,6x22
37607,Okay.,Michael,Season 6,6x22
37608,"And you might not like how I find it. [slides over table, leaves]",Dwight,Season 6,6x22
37624,[sitting on his Firebird's hood in front of a gym] Hi stranger.,Dwight,Season 6,6x22
37626,I work with Michael.,Dwight,Season 6,6x22
37628,Dwight Schrute. [they shake hands],Dwight,Season 6,6x22
37630,"All cases are solved with logic. The only logical way to find out if Donna Is a cheater is to seduce her, bring her to orgasm, then call Michael and tell him the sad news.",Dwight,Season 6,6x22
37631,"That's interesting. Wow, it's a little early for ice cream, don't you think?",Jim,Season 6,6x22
37632,"It's never too early for ice cream, Jim. But we didn't have any ice cream, so this is mayonnaise and black olives.",Michael,Season 6,6x22
37633,Oh!...,Pam,Season 6,6x22
37634,"Oh, my God",Jim,Season 6,6x22
37635,"It's comfort food, all right? [disgustedly] God.",Michael,Season 6,6x22
37636,"You know Michael, this whole Donna thing is gonna be okay, you just... stop beating yourself up.",Jim,Season 6,6x22
37637,"I know. Well, I hope you're right. We'll see what Dwight says.",Michael,Season 6,6x22
37638,Why do we have to see what Dwight says?,Pam,Season 6,6x22
37639,Because I have him investigating her. I'm waiting for a text update.,Michael,Season 6,6x22
37640,"Michael, no...",Jim,Season 6,6x22
37641,"No, no, no, no. Undo that. Undo that.",Pam,Season 6,6x22
37642,It's too late to undo it. I need to know. Otherwise this thing is going to spiral out of amok.,Michael,Season 6,6x22
37643,"Michael. Okay, I'm... I'm going to talk straight to you because I think you need to hear it. Michael.",Pam,Season 6,6x22
37644,"God, this is so disgusting.",Michael,Season 6,6x22
37645,Stop eating it! Do you wanna be happy? Look at you. You have a major self-destructive streak in you.,Pam,Season 6,6x22
37646,I know.,Michael,Season 6,6x22
37647,And you kind of torpedo every romantic relationship you're in.,Pam,Season 6,6x22
37648,"That's not true. [Pam stares him down] You're right, I ruin everything. And I've known some wonderful women. Holly, Carol, Jan.",Michael,Season 6,6x22
37649,Helene.,Pam,Season 6,6x22
37650,Helene?,Michael,Season 6,6x22
37651,My mother.,Pam,Season 6,6x22
37652,Oh.,Michael,Season 6,6x22
37653,"My mother, Helene. [Jim shakes his head]",Pam,Season 6,6x22
37654,"Oh, yeah. Yes, yes. Yes. All of, all of the greatest loves of my life.",Michael,Season 6,6x22
37655,"You should stop this, [pulls away mayo and olives bowl] and you should call Dwight right now.",Jim,Season 6,6x22
37656,[sighs] All right. [calls Dwight],Michael,Season 6,6x22
37657,"[at gym, looks ready to work out, checks phone, and tries to grab Donna's attention] Oh, gosh, we were both going for the same weight at the same time; you go ahead.",Dwight,Season 6,6x22
37659,"It's all yours. [strains loudly to lift two dumbbells and a free weight chained to strap around his head] Ah! [after first rep, Dwight is injured]",Dwight,Season 6,6x22
37661,"Yeah, I'm good. Hey, you know an exercise for two people that uses the whole body?",Dwight,Season 6,6x22
37663,Tractor pulling. Too bad there's not a tractor here.,Dwight,Season 6,6x22
37664,[moaning loudly on exercise machine while staring at Donna who's next to him] Oh. Oh. Oh. [groans loudly] One thing you need to know about me. I don't quit until something tears or pops. [chuckles] You look like you're getting a good workout. Can I feel your pulse?,Dwight,Season 6,6x22
37666,"Really? Hey, um... [Dwight gets up and walks sorely from his 'workout']",Dwight,Season 6,6x22
37668,Get out of my way. Huh!,Dwight,Season 6,6x22
37669,"Tomorrow's fertilizer, am I right?",Dwight,Season 6,6x22
37671,"Donna. Donna, wait, please. I'm sorry. Okay? Listen. We both know why I'm here: to see... you... naked... while... I'm... naked.",Dwight,Season 6,6x22
37673,"Donna, come... Ah! Grr! Ugh! [Dwight is very sore from his 'workout' and cannot chase Donna]",Dwight,Season 6,6x22
37674,You're back. What happened?,Michael,Season 6,6x22
37675,"Oh, I pulled muscles in both my thighs. Thanks for asking.",Dwight,Season 6,6x22
37676,"No, what happened with Donna?",Michael,Season 6,6x22
37677,"Yeah, no. She's not cheating. Oh, man! Will you help me work out this knot? Right here. [near his groin]",Dwight,Season 6,6x22
37678,Ugh!,Michael,Season 6,6x22
37679,Put your fingers here.,Dwight,Season 6,6x22
37680,No. No! Are you sure?,Michael,Season 6,6x22
37681,"I'm positive. Yeah, oh, and here's your expense receipts right there.",Dwight,Season 6,6x22
37682,Who eats eight protein bars?,Michael,Season 6,6x22
37683,People who don't trust egg whites.,Dwight,Season 6,6x22
37684,"Okay. Well, I am just glad this is all over.",Michael,Season 6,6x22
37685,"Oh, me too. And by the way, uh, I told her not to, but she's coming over here and she's furious.",Dwight,Season 6,6x22
37686,"What? No, she didn't say that.",Michael,Season 6,6x22
37687,"You're right. I was paraphrasing. What she actually said was, [pulls out notebook] 'What is with him? He is crazy. I'm coming over there to talk to him.' And this was after I have no other recourse but to tell her and gym security that you had me sent there to see if she was cheating. Also, I joined the gym. You'll be billed monthly. [lays down gym membership receipt on a chair in Michael's office.",Dwight,Season 6,6x22
37688,I am not paying for that membership.,Michael,Season 6,6x22
37689,"[sitting on the floor behind Erin's desk, sighs] Ohhh... mmm...",Michael,Season 6,6x22
37691,"No, I like the attention. Is she here yet?",Michael,Season 6,6x22
37693,That's her?,Michael,Season 6,6x22
37695,"Mm-hmm. Right. Right. Right. [Michael pretends to be speaking on the phone as Donna approaches] Okay, I'll talk to you later.",Michael,Season 6,6x22
37697,I didn't. Everybody else here did. Everybody convinced me that something was up. They poisoned my mind.,Michael,Season 6,6x22
37699,"Ye... pfff. Well, no. It's a lie. That's not what happened. I just like you. I can't believe I get to be with you. You work at an adult arcade. You could have any man you want.",Michael,Season 6,6x22
37701,"If you wanna dump me, I totally get it.",Michael,Season 6,6x22
37703,"Well, you are boner-ific. [Donna laughs]",Michael,Season 6,6x22
37705,...poop my pants.,Michael,Season 6,6x22
37707,"Oh, my God, Vero Beach. No. Is that on the water?",Michael,Season 6,6x22
37709,We are?,Michael,Season 6,6x22
37731,[to Pam] What?,Jim,Season 6,6x22
37732,Hmm? Oh. It's probably nothing.,Pam,Season 6,6x22
37733,"Okay, heart-shaped jewelry is not something that a woman buys for herself. A man definitely bought it for her recently, and it wasn't Michael.",Pam,Season 6,6x22
37734,"Wait, so are you... you like heart-shaped jewelry, though, right?",Jim,Season 6,6x22
37735,No. Except for the pendant that you bought me. Which I love.,Pam,Season 6,6x22
37739,"So it turns out Donna and I have a facebook friend of a friend in common, so I was able to see some of her pictures online. [pulls out picture of Donna embracing a man and smiling] This was taken two weeks ago. And this was taken the same night. [pulls out a picture of Donna kissing the same man] This photo was taken this morning. [shows a baby picture] It's Cece. [laughs] She's never gonna do anything wrong.",Pam,Season 6,6x22
37741,Wow. [Pam knocks on Michaels door and goes in] That's exciting.,Michael,Season 6,6x22
37742,"Hey, Michael.",Pam,Season 6,6x22
37743,Hey.,Michael,Season 6,6x22
37744,"I'm sorry to interrupt you. Um, I actually have something very important to talk to you about, business related.",Pam,Season 6,6x22
37745,Well it can wait. It can wait.,Michael,Season 6,6x22
37746,I lied it's personal. It's about me and Jim. We're... I just... you're the only person I can talk to.,Pam,Season 6,6x22
37747,Jim is her husband.,Michael,Season 6,6x22
37749,And...,Pam,Season 6,6x22
37750,"And they are having problems, so sh...",Michael,Season 6,6x22
37751,"No, not... we're not... we're not having problems. But it is personal. And I would love...",Pam,Season 6,6x22
37752,Good in bed.,Michael,Season 6,6x22
37753,"Yes. Yes, I desperately want to speak with you about my sex life with Jim.",Pam,Season 6,6x22
37754,"Oh, my God. Look at how cheap street level rooms are. Am I the only person who enjoys people watching?",Michael,Season 6,6x22
37755,[loudly] I need you to sign this! So bad!,Pam,Season 6,6x22
37756,"Okay, weirdo.",Michael,Season 6,6x22
37757,I love [leans over Michael's desk to look at his computer screen]... this idea is neat. I've never been. It sounds lovely. [meanwhile Michael looks at the pictures Pam printed out],Pam,Season 6,6x22
37759,"[to Michael] You're gonna wanna look at the date on that.  Oh, wow. Look at... golfing. [to Donna] Are you a golfer?",Pam,Season 6,6x22
37761,"Yeah, I just remembered that I have to go to the bathroom. Pam?",Michael,Season 6,6x22
37762,Absolutely. [both leave Michael's office],Pam,Season 6,6x22
37779,Who the hell is this? Who is this guy?,Michael,Season 6,6x22
37780,I don't know who he is.,Pam,Season 6,6x22
37781,God! Lowest of the low. That guy. Just a notch above Toby. You know what?,Michael,Season 6,6x22
37782,What?,Pam,Season 6,6x22
37783,"I'm gonna kill him. No, I'm not. I feel... I... no, I'm not going to kill him.",Michael,Season 6,6x22
37784,You just have to go in there. You have to hear it from her.,Pam,Season 6,6x22
37785,I have to hear it from her.,Michael,Season 6,6x22
37786,You have to settle down first.,Pam,Season 6,6x22
37787,I need to have her tell me herself. Right?,Michael,Season 6,6x22
37788,Okay. Okay. Yes.,Pam,Season 6,6x22
37789,I need to have her say...,Michael,Season 6,6x22
37790,"Yeah, but you have to calm...",Pam,Season 6,6x22
37791,"I need to say, 'What the hell is that? What the hell is that?'",Michael,Season 6,6x22
37792,"Okay. Look at this, look at this. Baby picture.",Pam,Season 6,6x22
37793,"No, God! No, no, oh, my God!",Michael,Season 6,6x22
37794,"[in baby voice] Hi, Michael, hi, Michael",Pam,Season 6,6x22
37795,[calms down] Okay. Okay. Okay.,Michael,Season 6,6x22
37797,You know what? We should really do something fun this week.,Michael,Season 6,6x22
37799,Wouldn't that be fun?,Michael,Season 6,6x22
37801,How about Thursday?,Michael,Season 6,6x22
37803,I can't do Thursday. Book club. How about Friday?,Michael,Season 6,6x22
37805,"Oh, really? 'cause I was thinking we could go to this concert. Spice Girls are opening for Weird Al. Front row. It'd be a great, great concert.",Michael,Season 6,6x22
37807,"Oh okay. Well, maybe I could stop by.",Michael,Season 6,6x22
37809,"Nope, that's Tuesday.",Michael,Season 6,6x22
37811,You're cheating. You're cheating on me.,Michael,Season 6,6x22

37814,[gasps] Did she see me?,Pam,Season 6,6x22
37815,[to Pam on floor] Nice effort.,Jim,Season 6,6x22
37830,Who is he?,Michael,Season 6,6x22
37832,The other man. Who's the guy? Who is it?,Michael,Season 6,6x22
37834,I'm the mistress?,Michael,Season 6,6x22
37835,"[on workout bicycle at gym] Okay, everybody, let's take this next hill.",Dwight,Season 6,6x22
37837,"You know what? You had your chance. You're no leader. Out of your seat, let's blast!",Dwight,Season 6,6x22
37839,No! The hill's a trap. Let's take the dirt road off to the side.,Dwight,Season 6,6x22
37841,"If they catch us, they will rape us. Go for the cliff. And three, two, one... jump! No! [points to those around him] You're dead, you're dead, you're dead. Good jump. You're barely alive. Okay, now nice cooldown. Check your pulse rate.",Dwight,Season 6,6x22
37843,"Toby has been leaving radon kits everywhere, like he owns the place.  The first time I threw mine away, I thought it was an ant trap. [finds radon kit in between his blinds in his office] But I figured I'd rather live with ants than with his creepy little disc. [throws it away] The second time... I thought it was one of those, you know, those things you turn over and it moos. [finds another radon kit on top of his cabinet] Like a cow thing. But upon closer examination, it was another ant trap, so I threw it away. And the third time... I did it out of spite. [takes radon kit from the top of the blinds of his office window and slams it into the trash can]",Michael,Season 6,6x23
37844,Pfffffttt.,Michael,Season 6,6x23
37846,"You're kidding me? God! You say radon is silent, but deadly, and then you expect me not to make farting noises with my mouth? What is this?",Michael,Season 6,6x23
37848,"You know what? We're not gonna die of radon, we're gonna die of boredom.",Michael,Season 6,6x23
37850,"Right? And if I had a gun with two bullets and I was in a room with Hitler, Bin Laden, and Toby, I would shoot Toby twice.",Michael,Season 6,6x23
37852,That's... not okay.,Jim,Season 6,6x23
37853,"Okay, alright.",Michael,Season 6,6x23
37854,"You were being really funny, and then you went too far.",Dwight,Season 6,6x23
37855,I would kill Bin Laden and then Toby.,Michael,Season 6,6x23
37856,"No, hmmm... that's still...",Dwight,Season 6,6x23
37858,"Okay geniuses, how would you do it?",Michael,Season 6,6x23
37862,I don't know.,Michael,Season 6,6x23
37864,"Stanley, please, this is serious!",Jim,Season 6,6x23
37866,"Yes, we stab Toby through the heart with an icicle.",Michael,Season 6,6x23
37867,"Come on, the whole two bullet thing is a red herring. Here's how you do it:  You line them all up, you take one bullet, shoot them all through the throat at the same time. Watch this.

37873,Good work. [clapping],Michael,Season 6,6x23
37874,What flavors did you get? [yawns],Pam,Season 6,6x23
37876,[reading flavors] Despera-dough. Witchy-womanilla. Why do they do this?,Pam,Season 6,6x23
37878,"No, no, no, it's fine. I was just commenting. We gotta get these out, open 'em up.",Pam,Season 6,6x23
37880,"Yeah, and when Michael gets a broken heart, this whole place comes to a halt, so we're just trying to get out in front of this.",Pam,Season 6,6x23

We make 'em come to work, and we work 'em, and we make 'em sit next to all the people they screwed over. And, and we pay 'em but we make 'em feel like they did something really wrong. The one question I have is, do we give them a Christmas bonus? I say yes, it's Christmas, but right after they're back in the thick of it.",Michael,Season 6,6x24

38325,It doesn't matter what I know.,Michael,Season 6,6x24

38350,Really?,Jim,Season 6,6x24
38352,I have rights.,Michael,Season 6,6x24

38358,"Whole year, actually. My favorite restaurant closed down.",Michael,Season 6,6x24
38360,"And my new favorite restaurant sucks... I bought a video camera last year, and I was looking at the tapes, and there were only like twelve minutes that I felt was worth taping the whole year. And most of that was just birds in my condo complex. What is that? ... I miss Holly.",Michael,Season 6,6x24
38362,Holly Flax from the Nashua branch. Best HR rep that Dunder Mifflin has ever seen. It's not been a blockbuster year for me financially. My Blockbuster stock is down.,Michael,Season 6,6x24

We liked the last guy, Siddiq, because he kept to himself, and we also thought he might have been a terrorist. You know what, I'm going to leave you with one other thought.

38523,"Well, then, why aren't you bugging me to fire everybody who's bad? You just want me to fire Luke. That's reverse nepotism.  He should not be punished because he is related to me and bad at what he does!",Michael,Season 7,7x1
38526,"Because I wanted you to come to me and say, 'Wow, he is so great.' And I was gonna say, 'Well, it's in the genes.' And I was actually gonna be wearing jeans. And I'd point to them, right? No. But you ruined it. So, thank you very much. Here he comes. Guys, look. I don't want you to treat him like anyone else in the office. I just want you to treat him like my nephew.

Occasionally he will need a little push, and I will do that, and he'll slow down, and I'll push him again. That's the thing with kids, you have to keep pushing. You have to push them until they push you back. And then you push some more. It's all about give and take, but mostly it's about pushing each other.",Michael,Season 7,7x1
38573,"Yeah, yeah. Like when he presses 'Doors closed' the doors open. Or he presses 'lobby' it goes to third floor, stuff like that. Can you do that?",Pam,Season 7,7x1

38715,"Yeah, what happened Dwight?",Pam,Season 7,7x2
38716,Ok.,Jim,Season 7,7x2
38717,"You guys know me. You know that I'm not one for fancy things, but there was this one thing. It was in a fancy store. And it caught the corner of my eye when I took Mose down to the Mall to get his blood pressure at the Rite-Aid. And I thought, you know, maybe I deserve this. You know, I had a great crop yield this fall...",Dwight,Season 7,7x2
38718,So what happened?,Pam,Season 7,7x2
38719,"I went to the store and I pressed the buzzer, and they looked right at me, and then they looked away.

38723,"Wait, wait, wait. That's actually a really good idea Kelly.",Jim,Season 7,7x2

38745,"No, no. I want to hear you tell it.",Jim,Season 7,7x2

38760,"Well, the other night, I was sitting at the table, eating my penis... I mean peas. That was weird. Aaaah... weird. I think that was ... I was probed. By an alien life form. An A.L.F.

38825,"Yeah. You know what? He took me to a baseball game once, I remember. It was weird though. They took the pitcher out of the game.

39710,"I told you! You're an exec at Stark Industries, a corporation you inherited from your father-",Dwight,Season 7,7x5
39711,"Will you stop? Stop it, stop it. Here's the story-they need Meredith somewhere else asap, okay?",Jim,Season 7,7x5
39713,So you're taking over. You just gotta get her out of there as soon as you can.,Jim,Season 7,7x5
39715,Then make him pitch to you.,Dwight,Season 7,7x5
39716,Yes.,Jim,Season 7,7x5
39717,We gotta see what he's got.,Dwight,Season 7,7x5
39718,Exactly. You can do this.,Jim,Season 7,7x5
39719,"Okay, and remember-you're not gay.",Dwight,Season 7,7x5
39720,Stop it! It's gonna be great.,Jim,Season 7,7x5
39722,"And listen if anything else happens, just...roll with it.",Jim,Season 7,7x5
39728,Who else we got?,Jim,Season 7,7x5
39729,Okay. You're a young hotshot from Stark Industries. You've just bought this company. Meredith is fired. It's a whole new regime. He's gotta pitch to you now.,Dwight,Season 7,7x5
39731,Great. Sounds awesome. Just have him pitch to you.,Jim,Season 7,7x5
39732,Don't let us down.,Michael,Season 7,7x5
39738,"No, no, no....",Michael,Season 7,7x5
39739,"No, no, no, no...",Jim,Season 7,7x5
39740,I'm goin 'in!,Michael,Season 7,7x5
39741,"Michael! No, Michael, stop it! No!",Dwight,Season 7,7x5
39742,"Stop, stop! Oh, my god! [enters office] Okay. Stop it, stop it, stop it. Gross! Stop it, please. Everybody, stop.",Michael,Season 7,7x5
39744,"I said stop. Okay, Danny...this is not Pennsylvania Solartech. This is Dunder-Mifflin Paper Company. This is Meredith Palmer-",Michael,Season 7,7x5
39746,"Don't! Get away from him. Please, just leave. Get out of here. Go. Forever.",Michael,Season 7,7x5
39748,"I owe you...a most sincere and humble apology. We were trying to watch you to see your sales technique, so we could stop losing so many clients to you.",Michael,Season 7,7x5
39750,A surveillance room next to this one.,Michael,Season 7,7x5
39752,Yes. And it's the sincerest form of flattery.,Michael,Season 7,7x5
39754,Well-,Michael,Season 7,7x5
39756,"Okay. You know what, it wasn't just me. Jim and Dwight are behind that wall in the surveillance room and it was their plan as well.",Michael,Season 7,7x5
39757,No!,Dwight,Season 7,7x5
39758,"No, no, no, no.",Jim,Season 7,7x5
39760,"No, we don't. Here's-here's my point. Danny, listen, you have to understand that we are not normally like this. We just-we wanted to know your tricks.",Michael,Season 7,7x5
39762,"You are, you are. You are! Stop it, stop it. Stop. [closes door] You are a good salesman. And because of that...I want you to work for me.",Michael,Season 7,7x5
39764,"So, you will?",Michael,Season 7,7x5
39766,"Hold it, hold it. [forcing door closed] Hold on, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait. Wait. Danny, I want you to look at me. Do you want your life to be better...or to be worse or to stay the same?",Michael,Season 7,7x5
39768,"Answer the question. Do you want a better life, Danny?",Michael,Season 7,7x5
39770,"I know, I know.",Michael,Season 7,7x5
39772,"Do you want more freedom, less freedom, or to stay the same?",Michael,Season 7,7x5
39774,"I can give you more money-there's your better life. I can let you come and go as you please-there's your freedom. And you already know Dunder-Mifflin has the best service and the best prices, but you beat us anyway. Can you imagine how well you would do selling our stuff?",Michael,Season 7,7x5
39775,"Everyone, may I have your attention? I would like to introduce you to Mr. Danny Cordray. He is going to be joining us as our new traveling salesman. Say hello to Danny!",Michael,Season 7,7x5
39777,"O-kay. You know what? No. No. This is not some sort of construction site...or all of Italy, where you can just go around treating people like meat. We are to respect him. I respect him because he reminds me of somebody. Can anybody guess who that is?",Michael,Season 7,7x5
39780,No. No. No. Somebody in this office.,Michael,Season 7,7x5
39783,"No, me. Right? Sorta like...a little younger version of me.",Michael,Season 7,7x5
39785,Michael?,Dwight,Season 7,7x5
39786,Yes.,Michael,Season 7,7x5
39787,Can I talk to you about something?,Dwight,Season 7,7x5
39788,"No, you may not.",Michael,Season 7,7x5
39789,It's about this very announcement you just made.,Dwight,Season 7,7x5
39790,I said no.,Michael,Season 7,7x5
39791,Michael-,Dwight,Season 7,7x5
39792,We're not-,Michael,Season 7,7x5
39793,"Michael, I think you really want to talk to him.",Jim,Season 7,7x5
39794,"Okay. Let's-all right, all right. Let's talk. Please don't let him leave. [pointing to Danny] Don't leave. Don't let him.",Michael,Season 7,7x5
39796,You hired him?,Jim,Season 7,7x5
39797,"Guys, let me ask you something. Do you want your life to be better or worse or stay the same?",Michael,Season 7,7x5
39799,"Okay. Well...get ready, 'cause it's gonna get better.",Michael,Season 7,7x5
39801,"No, no. Wrong. He would have stolen your clients, but you know what? He can't now. This guy used to steal sales from us; now, he's going to steal sales for us.",Michael,Season 7,7x5
39802,Where's he gonna sit? There's no more seats.,Dwight,Season 7,7x5
39803,"He doesn't need to sit, he's a traveling salesman. Look, I am not going to exclude good people from our staff simply because they are threatening to you. And unless you have a better argument than that, I suggest you leave.",Michael,Season 7,7x5
39805,Where's he gonna park? There's no more reserved parking spots.,Dwight,Season 7,7x5
39806,Good-bye!,Michael,Season 7,7x5
39829,Did ya?,Jim,Season 7,7x5
39831,I'm just kidding. She told me about it.,Jim,Season 7,7x5
39833,Oh.,Jim,Season 7,7x5
39835,You snubbed her.,Dwight,Season 7,7x5
39836,"Dwight, please.",Jim,Season 7,7x5
39837,"Let me handle this, Jim. Drop the act, Cordray, okay? We all know that you probably thought that Pam was too 'meh' or thin without being toned. But I wanna tell you something-she is one of the plain hearty women of Scranton that make this city great. And so what if she doesn't wear makeup? [Pam mouthing 'I wear makeup'] We like her better that way! And you steal clients, don't you? Don't you!",Dwight,Season 7,7x5
39839,"Oh, that's different, is it? Okay...thief. You better check your things, people. In fact, where are my keys? Oh, there in my pocket. False alarm. Okay. [awkward pause] So...you're gonna be workin' here?",Dwight,Season 7,7x5
39841,Welcome aboard.,Dwight,Season 7,7x5
39843,"Hey, crazy, um...so...that's it? You're just-you're fine?",Jim,Season 7,7x5
39844,"It's after 5:00, Jim. I'm not gonna take this home. [shakes Danny's hand]",Dwight,Season 7,7x5
39846,Pleasure.,Dwight,Season 7,7x5
39848,"This morning, Danny Cordray stole a sale from me. So what do I do? I go out and I steal Danny Cordray. The sale that mattered, I made. Boom. Funny thing about it, we don't even need him. We already have Packer on the road. Chhguuh! Crap. I forgot about Packer.",Michael,Season 7,7x5
39862,"I don't know. [looks at Stanley, who took his mug and is drinking out of it] Oh! That's... not... yours.",Jim,Season 7,7x6
39863,"Stanley just drank OJ out of my mug, and didn't seem to realize that it wasn't his hot coffee. So the question has to be asked, is there no limit to what he won't notice?",Jim,Season 7,7x6
39870,"[standing outside the conference room, wearing fake teeth, watching Stanley walk in] All right, everybody, take a seat. As you may have heard, our branch on the planet Jupiter is up eight thousand percent in sales!",Michael,Season 7,7x6
39873,"[turns around, is wearing a mustache] Bye, Stanley! Love you! [waves, Stanley leaves]",Pam,Season 7,7x6
39874,"[standing next to a pony] So long, Stanley!",Dwight,Season 7,7x6
39879,"A lot of people are really getting into Halloween this year! [puts head down over fake bomb made from cardboard, high pitched voice] Six seconds, MacGruber! [lifts head] Pam's got a lot of fun stuff planned! [puts head down, high pitched voice] Uh, two seconds MacGruber! [lifts head] Including a... costume contest, and bobbing for apples, and a Ouija board... OHHH! BOOM! OHH EXPLOSION! [throws fake bomb, takes off sunglasses, points to camera] MACGRUBERRRR!",Michael,Season 7,7x6
39880,"People are really into the costume contest this year. Might have something to do with the prize, maybe you've heard of it. The 2011 Scranton Wilkes-Barre coupon book worth over fifteen thousand dollars in savings!",Pam,Season 7,7x6
39881,Stop.,Jim,Season 7,7x6
39882,"[has his hands around Jim's neck] Too late! If I was the real Scranton Strangler, you'd be so strangled right now. If you're out there, strangler, you will get caught! By me.",Dwight,Season 7,7x6
39883,Sounds like someone's really trying to convince us that he's not the Scranton Strangler.,Jim,Season 7,7x6
39884,To my chickens I'm the Scranton Strangler.  [looks at Pam] Oh-ho! That's very funny. Looks like someone decided to dress up as old Dwight Schrute's mom.,Dwight,Season 7,7x6
39885,What?,Pam,Season 7,7x6
39886,You're only one third as beautiful and only half her height.,Dwight,Season 7,7x6
39887,"I'm supposed to be Olive Oyl. And it makes more sense when I'm standing next to Popeye, but... Jim doesn't want to put his costume on.",Pam,Season 7,7x6
39888,[places pipe in mouth] I am Popeye!,Jim,Season 7,7x6
39889,"I've never really been a costume guy. Even when I was a kid, it just felt like something I was too old for. And then this morning, when Pam hands me this little number [holds up Popeye costume, shakes head] ...no.",Jim,Season 7,7x6
39891,MACGRUBER!,Michael,Season 7,7x6
39893,"Oh, here we go!",Michael,Season 7,7x6
39895,[laughs] OH! Who likes to water ski on Lake Erie? No wai-where does Dracula like to water ski?,Michael,Season 7,7x6
39896,Lake Erie.,Dwight,Season 7,7x6
39898,"So, wait, drivers are going to be able to sell paper on the road?",Michael,Season 7,7x6
39904,Blackula!,Michael,Season 7,7x6
39906,"Oh, so... I almost forgot. You'll find this hilarious. Apparently corporate is going to have drivers sell paper on their routes now. That's like, exactly sort of the idea that you had.",Michael,Season 7,7x6
39908,"Yeah. I'm sorry. I blew this. You should have gotten credit for that, man.",Michael,Season 7,7x6
39910,Really? We're good?,Michael,Season 7,7x6
39912,Okay. [reaches out and shakes Darryl's hand] Okay.,Michael,Season 7,7x6
39914,Oh. It's a ream of paper. Thought you might hit me.,Michael,Season 7,7x6
39915,Darryl Philbin is the greatest guy in the world. And you know what I'd like? I would like to have all the racists brought together and take Darryl Philbin out to lunch. Just to see what they're missing.,Michael,Season 7,7x6
39933,Pam is gonna choose whoever has a scent most like that of her father. Does anyone remember what her dad smelled like?,Dwight,Season 7,7x6
39936,"So four years ago, when I was in Stamford, Connecticut, and dating someone else, Pam went on two dates with Danny. Which was obviously the greatest love story ever told, given how much people are walking on eggshells around us.",Jim,Season 7,7x6
39937,We were basically Romeo and Juliet.,Pam,Season 7,7x6
39938,That's right.,Jim,Season 7,7x6
39939,Except where Juliet doesn't have that great a time and Romeo doesn't call back after two dates.,Pam,Season 7,7x6
39940,Yikes.,Jim,Season 7,7x6
39941,But I've learned to love again. [puts her arm on Jim's shoulder] He's a cartoon sailor.,Pam,Season 7,7x6
39942,"Oh, no.",Jim,Season 7,7x6
39943,And looks so handsome in his UNIFORM! Please?,Pam,Season 7,7x6
39944,"No. No, I'm not gonna-no.",Jim,Season 7,7x6
39946,I don't care.,Jim,Season 7,7x6
39951,Madge from the warehouse just made her first sale. Madge. We should have been doing this a long time ago.,Jim,Season 7,7x6
39952,Erin! Would you please do me a solid and get Darryl Philbin on the speakerphone?,Michael,Season 7,7x6
39954,"Hi, Darryl, come out here, please.",Michael,Season 7,7x6
39956,"You need to stop being so shy, come out here, and embrace who you really are, superstar!",Michael,Season 7,7x6
39958,"Yeah, I bet it is! If you're gonna do your job well here, you gotta get used to being embarrassed.",Michael,Season 7,7x6
39960,"[leans over toward Erin] Um, hit the speakerphone button. The speakerphone button? The same button as you hit before... or sit on it.",Pam,Season 7,7x6
39961,This whole delivery slash sales idea? You know whose idea that was? That was Darryl Philbin's. He thought of that way before the corporate fat suits.,Michael,Season 7,7x6
39963,"I got in the way. I said no. And it just stopped. But then corporate comes up with this idea, but you know what? They need to know that it was yours. And I don't care if I take a bullet. We're gonna call them, we're gonna put them on speakerphone right now...",Michael,Season 7,7x6
39965,And we are going to straighten this out.,Michael,Season 7,7x6
39967,Mmhm!,Michael,Season 7,7x6
39969,I'm a little peeved at Darryl right now.,Michael,Season 7,7x6
39970,He went to Gabe behind your back.,Dwight,Season 7,7x6
39971,"No, he didn't go behind my back. He went over my head.",Michael,Season 7,7x6
39972,He went over your head to go behind your back.,Dwight,Season 7,7x6
39973,What is taking someone from behind?,Michael,Season 7,7x6
39974,"No. Shh. Michael, listen. This cannot stand. We can't have workers going straight to corporate. Makes your job superfluous.",Dwight,Season 7,7x6
39975,"It was a good idea, though.",Michael,Season 7,7x6
39976,Yeah. Here's another good idea. Corporate chain of command. We need to strangle Darryl's idea.,Dwight,Season 7,7x6
40003,"Garbage magnet. [throws magnet] Garbage magnet, God! Magnets are interesting enough, you don't need to tart them up with some design. [to Michael] I can't believe this doesn't make you mad!",Dwight,Season 7,7x6
40004,[staring at Gabe and Kevin] What the hell are they talking about?,Michael,Season 7,7x6
40005,"Hmm, Kevin and Gabe. Probably about the extremes of the human physique.",Dwight,Season 7,7x6
40006,"Do you think that Kevin is going over my head? I don't-[sees Kevin and Gabe fist-bump] Oh my GOD. Okay. All right. All right. You know what? That's inappropriate, Kevin. I am your boss, and if you have something to say, it goes through me, and then I take it to Gabe. Chain of command. Do you understand?",Michael,Season 7,7x6
40008,"Oh, you're sorry?",Michael,Season 7,7x6
40010,What did you just thought?,Michael,Season 7,7x6
40012,All right.,Michael,Season 7,7x6
40014,Okay.,Michael,Season 7,7x6
40016,"Well, don't let it happen again.",Michael,Season 7,7x6
40018,I-,Michael,Season 7,7x6
40022,That is crazy. We would never care if Andy or Kevin went to your party.,Jim,Season 7,7x6
40024,"Oh, my gosh! People keep blowing it out of proportion! It's not even a history.",Pam,Season 7,7x6
40026,It's not like you guys had some long relationship right? Big painful breakup I don't know about?,Jim,Season 7,7x6
40028,It was two.,Pam,Season 7,7x6
40030,"No, we um, we had plans for a third, but then I don't know, you never called me back, so...",Pam,Season 7,7x6
40031,Oooh! You can't handle the truth! [laughs],Jim,Season 7,7x6
40033,"Yeah? [stops laughing] It was though, that's what happened.",Pam,Season 7,7x6
40035,Hmm-mm.,Pam,Season 7,7x6
40036,"Okay, this whole going over my head-gate? Is making people act weird. The chain of command is crumbling. Do you know what just happened? I just made Kevin cry. And Gabe looks like Lady Gaga. That's not Halloween. Halloween should be a day in which we honor monsters and not be mad at each other.",Michael,Season 7,7x6
40038,You went over my head. And then you lied to my face. So my head and my face have taken a beating.,Michael,Season 7,7x6
40040,"Okay, that might help. If you said 'I'm sorry' in front of everybody.",Michael,Season 7,7x6
40042,In front of me.,Michael,Season 7,7x6
40044,So that's it.,Michael,Season 7,7x6
40046,Is it?,Michael,Season 7,7x6
40054,"Okay, everybody! After you walk the runway everyone has to vote for who gets the coupon book. And you can't vote for yourself.",Pam,Season 7,7x6
40056,"Yeah, I gotta get in on this. [mocking Darryl] Hey, it's cool, man, I work in the warehouse! I'm cool! I'm hip and I'm jive! And I don't care about nobody! Do you know who I am? Happy Halloween, jerk!",Michael,Season 7,7x6
40057,Still don't know who I am? I'll give you a hint. I go over other people's heads.,Michael,Season 7,7x6
40058,"Michael, this is a bad idea.",Pam,Season 7,7x6
40059,What's a bad idea?,Michael,Season 7,7x6
40060,"Dressing up as somebody-I mean, when has that ever worked for you?",Pam,Season 7,7x6
40061,"NEVER! [tosses wig] Okay, you know what? Fine.  I'm not Darryl. And thank God I'm not Darryl.",Michael,Season 7,7x6
40065,Angela as the nurse!,Pam,Season 7,7x6
40068,"Hey, can I play? Why don't you ask if Darryl is a bad friend who backstabs people in the back?",Michael,Season 7,7x6
40069,We have one question to ask the spirit world and you want us to ask that?,Jim,Season 7,7x6
40071,Aaah! Darryl moved it. You moved it.,Michael,Season 7,7x6
40073,"Dwight, you saw Darryl move it, right?",Michael,Season 7,7x6
40074,Let's just say I saw exactly what the two of you wanted me to see.,Dwight,Season 7,7x6
40075,"I know how to sit on a fence. Hell, I can even sleep on a fence. The trick is to do it face down with the post in your mouth.",Dwight,Season 7,7x6
40076,If you had one word you would use to describe Darryl what would that word be?,Michael,Season 7,7x6
40083,Hey.,Jim,Season 7,7x6
40085,"When you work hard, you play hard around here.  Even if you don't work hard. Oh, here's something. Uh, why didn't you ever call Pam back?",Jim,Season 7,7x6
40087,"Yeah. I mean, I'm not saying that everyone has to fall in love, or anything, I'm just saying... but you know, to not even call her back is...",Jim,Season 7,7x6
40089,Could be. But you also called her the second time so you had the number right.,Jim,Season 7,7x6
40091,Nope.,Jim,Season 7,7x6
40097,I'd remember talking about Jim. That wasn't it.,Pam,Season 7,7x6
40098,Just tell her the real reason.,Jim,Season 7,7x6
40100,Hey. She had a nice time. It seems rude.,Jim,Season 7,7x6
40101,"I did. And it's just one of those things that's going to keep gnawing at me, like 'gnaw, gnaw, why? Why didn't he? I have no idea why.'",Pam,Season 7,7x6
40103,"Hey, man.",Jim,Season 7,7x6
40104,"Thank you! Thank you. I got it. Now I know. You thought I was a little dorky. You know? [gibberish sounds] Okay. Well, excuuuuse me.",Pam,Season 7,7x6
40106,Thank you.,Michael,Season 7,7x6
40109,"If they're good ideas, I'm not gonna say no!",Michael,Season 7,7x6
40111,"That was-okay, you make one mistake in fifteen years and you drag me over the coals, after everything I did for you?",Michael,Season 7,7x6
40113,Oh...,Michael,Season 7,7x6
40115,Well...,Michael,Season 7,7x6
40118,"Stop it! Stop, stop. We're thinking. We're thinking about it.",Michael,Season 7,7x6
40120,"You don't have to point to the fact that we're thinking about it. Stop it! Just let us think. Okay, next time you have a really great idea, we will put it in a hat, and then we will have Erin pick it out of the hat and let her decide.",Michael,Season 7,7x6
40123,I am not budging on the hat issue.,Michael,Season 7,7x6
40125,Okay. We both reserve the right to go to Jo if we disagree with Gabe.,Michael,Season 7,7x6
40127,"Unless you and I decide we want to talk to Jo, then we'll give her a call.",Michael,Season 7,7x6
40129,Sorry I was a jerk.,Michael,Season 7,7x6
40130,Friends fight. Friends fight.,Michael,Season 7,7x6
40137,"To be honest, I still can't believe he didn't call her back. Who doesn't call a dork like that back?",Jim,Season 7,7x6
40138,"Oh, wow!",Pam,Season 7,7x6
40139,[holding Cece] Spinach in a can. Power eat spinach. [Popeye sound],Jim,Season 7,7x6
40140,"Aww, my hero!",Pam,Season 7,7x6
40141,"Okay, everyone, I've tallied the votes, and the winner... of the costume celebration spectacular... and the Scranton Wilkes-Barre coupon book... Oscar Martinez.",Pam,Season 7,7x6
40145,"I know a lot of us have been feeling under the weather lately. It's that time of year. And according to a study done by the University of Arizona, they've discovered that your keyboards have hundreds of times more bacteria, per square inch, than a toilet seat.",Pam,Season 7,7x7
40147,"That's true, that's true. I dated her momma, and you know what-",Michael,Season 7,7x7
40148,Stop.,Jim,Season 7,7x7
40149,"[under his breath] Um... kay. Uh, alright.",Michael,Season 7,7x7
40150,One of the simplest ways to cut down on the spread of germs is to use something called the vampire cough.,Pam,Season 7,7x7
40152,"Oh, no, it's just that if a vampire had to cough, he would do it like this. [coughs into elbow]",Pam,Season 7,7x7
40153,Uh-huh. Right. And ruin their cloaks? Do you have any idea how expensive wool is in Transylvania? [looks at camera] 'Cause of the euro.,Dwight,Season 7,7x7
40154,"Well, other things you can do to help cut down on the spread of disease are to wash your hands regularly. Don't come in if you're sick.",Pam,Season 7,7x7
40155,[rolls his eyes and shakes his head] Uh...,Dwight,Season 7,7x7
40156,"And get your flu shot. Also, I'm going to set up hand sanitizing stations around the office.",Pam,Season 7,7x7
40157,"NO, no, no. They will cost you your life.",Dwight,Season 7,7x7
40158,Elaborate.,Jim,Season 7,7x7
40159,"The worst thing you can do for your immune system is to coddle it. They need to fight their own battles. If Sabre really cared about our well-being, they would set up hand de-sanitizing stations. A simple bowl at every juncture filled with dirt, vomit, fecal matter...",Dwight,Season 7,7x7
40160,I'm not - I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that.,Pam,Season 7,7x7
40161,Exposing yourself to germs is the best way to make yourself stronger.,Dwight,Season 7,7x7

40163,Yes. I would welcome it.,Dwight,Season 7,7x7
40164,"[sneezes on Dwight, looks at camera] You're welcome.",Jim,Season 7,7x7

40202,Good morning.,Michael,Season 7,7x7
40209,"Good morning. Dwight Schrute. Thank you all for your prayers and your remembrances. Like Justin and his disfigurement, I too have had a horrible year.

40225,I did... say that.,Jim,Season 7,7x7
40227,"Jim and Pam and Cece really seem to be clicking. They are totally gelling. It's as if they leave my office and they go to another office that sells happiness. And good for them. That's great, because, you know, the paper industry's not gonna last forever.",Michael,Season 7,7x7
40229,Mm. No. Wrong on both counts.,Jim,Season 7,7x7

40252,"Nope, and we're gonna need a loaves and fishes kind of miracle to feed 'em all.",Pam,Season 7,7x7
40254,[to Cece] Hm. Don't listen to her. She's just jealous 'cause she doesn't get to come home to someone as cute as you.,Pam,Season 7,7x7

40256,I don't know. I'm just hungry.,Pam,Season 7,7x7

40294,All right. And cider.,Jim,Season 7,7x7

40302,"Well, it's, it's-",Michael,Season 7,7x7
40304,"No. Okay, you know what? This is inappropriate. What is wrong with you guys? What is wrong with you? What is so horrible about wanting to get together and do something nice? Why did you guys even come today? What's so great about your lives that you think you're better than everybody else? That you can make fun of everybody else? You're mean. You're mean girls.

41171,Try 'Control P'.,Michael,Season 7,7x10
41173,Not if the printer isn't hooked up. You are making some very dangerous assumptions Oscar.,Michael,Season 7,7x10

41201,No.,Jim,Season 7,7x10
41203,"He's trying to set you up Michael. What's going to happen is he's going to try and bring up what ever you're talking about in a very casual way, but secretly he'll be trying to trip you up, and when he does, boom, its awful. Haven't you noticed that I don't bring up the Tour de France around him?",Jim,Season 7,7x10
41204,Yes.,Michael,Season 7,7x10
41206,"Alright, well I just need to learn everything about China. To be safe I should learn everything about everything but I don't have time. Okay, okay, I'll just learn about China and science and geography and math and literary.",Michael,Season 7,7x10

41217,We need everything back the way it was.,Pam,Season 7,7x10
41218,"You don't wanna move. Moving is one of the most stressful things you can do in life. You'll probably just take it out on your kid. Jim will turn to the drink. The family will fall apart, and twenty five years from now, Cece will become world famous...  for stripping.",Dwight,Season 7,7x10
41219,"That's a sad story. I have another one. We move, the other tenants follow, the bank takes the building, takes your farm, takes your car and beats the crap out of you. Penniless, you die, and my daughter Cece dances on your grave... fully clothed. [lights turn off, Pam and Dwight begin to wave their arms to alert the sensor]",Pam,Season 7,7x10

41266,What's the exact square footage.,Dwight,Season 7,7x10

41268,How many offices are there? Oh I'll just look at the one sheet myself.,Dwight,Season 7,7x10
41269,"Oh, actually I don't know what I did with the one sheet. Y'know, that's the problem. You only have one sheet.",Pam,Season 7,7x10
41270,"[chuckles] You're a funny guy Pam. What's the first thing you guys are gonna do when you move in to the new office? I'm going to walk down the hall and say 'Wow, I can't believe this is real, but it is.' I can't wait.",Dwight,Season 7,7x10

41316,"I am talking about freedom, about choice. America, I don't think you need to worry. Because if you want to beat China you will. If you don't, that's fine. That my friend, is your victory.

It is not going to be tacky, deli platter food. It's not gonna have a big, fat, gross Santa Claus. It's gonna be cool, sleek Santa.",Michael,Season 7,7x11
41486,Okay. Sure.,Michael,Season 7,7x11
41488,You never know about the press.,Michael,Season 7,7x11
41490,Could he help us with some parking tickets?,Michael,Season 7,7x11
41492,"Well, then he's not a senator.",Michael,Season 7,7x11
41494,Okay.,Michael,Season 7,7x11

41498,"Yes. But don't get too excited, 'cause I didn't have a lot of time this year.",Pam,Season 7,7x11
41499,Me neither. Whew.,Jim,Season 7,7x11
41500,Okay.,Pam,Season 7,7x11
41501,"I've been working forever on Jim's present. He always gives me the best Christmas gifts. He'll take a memory or a private joke, and he'll create something totally unique. I love them. So this year I made him something. A comic book. It stars Jimmy Halpert, a mild-mannered paper Salesman who, while riding his bike through the forest, is bitten by a radioactive bear, becomes 'bear man'. Wreaks havoc on the office. It's really good.",Pam,Season 7,7x11
41502,"[A note is on Jim's computer that says, 'It is time. Parking lot at noon.' Jim nods and hands it to Dwight who burns it.]",Jim,Season 7,7x11

41507,"Yes, that's me. Come on it.",Michael,Season 7,7x11
41508,"[scats awkwardly] There's nothing classier than boring Jazz music. I am here to tell ya. And I made a bit of a judgment call. I hired one musician, because I thought, what's better, to hire an entire quartet for half an hour, or one bassist for the entire day?",Michael,Season 7,7x11
41509,"Hey, uh, any volunteers to come with me to go buy a Christmas tree?",Pam,Season 7,7x11
41511,Why do you always think that girls are gonna be at the party? No one invited girls. It's just us.,Pam,Season 7,7x11
41515,"Oh, do you mean Darryl? That's a great idea. I'll ask him.",Pam,Season 7,7x11
41517,Yeah. He works here. We all know him.,Pam,Season 7,7x11
41519,Cool.,Pam,Season 7,7x11
41527,"Hey, sorry, I really didn't want to come in. It's just that we have to go buy a new Christmas tree, and we're hoping we could borrow your truck.",Pam,Season 7,7x11
41531,"Okay. Sorry. We'll uh, we'll leave you alone.",Pam,Season 7,7x11
41533,"When Holly gets here, I want you to be very helpful to her.",Michael,Season 7,7x11
41535,"She doesn't need an internet presence, you just know.",Michael,Season 7,7x11
41538,What the hell are you doing here? You're supposed to be in the courthouse.,Michael,Season 7,7x11

41589,Aww...,Jim,Season 7,7x11

41595,"Oh, and you have a Woody. Bah! [the both chuckle] Oh, I love toy...",Michael,Season 7,7x11

41599,You know who my favorite character in Toy Story is? Andy's mom.,Michael,Season 7,7x11

41628,"Well Darryl, no kid wants to buy their own Christmas presents.",Pam,Season 7,7x11
41630,"No, you should have her mom do the boring Christmas stuff on her time. You should be associated with the fun parts of Christmas.",Pam,Season 7,7x11

41680,"I mean, help, if it's something simple, like add page numbers or laminate it or...",Pam,Season 7,7x11
41682,No.,Pam,Season 7,7x11
41685,"Hey, Toby.",Jim,Season 7,7x11
41687,No way.,Jim,Season 7,7x11
41689,That's increadible.,Jim,Season 7,7x11
41691,You know what's crazy?,Jim,Season 7,7x11
41693,"I can't reconnect with you right now. Hold on one second. [he hurls a snowball at Dwight with a lacrosse stick, misses, and shatters a window, everyone gasps] Excuse me. [clears throat]",Jim,Season 7,7x11
41694,"I guess there are just some people who you stay together with when you transfer, and some people you don't. And that's just the way it is. And I can be mature about that. [clip of Michael throwing Holly's Woody in the trash and pouring coffee on it]",Michael,Season 7,7x11
41699,"What if Meredith was taking her smoking break below that window? You know what would have happened? The shards of glass would have shaved her face right off. And, yes, it might have been funny. But it also would have been incredibly tragic.",Michael,Season 7,7x11
41700,I could not agree more. And just want to state for the record that I am intending to sue Jim for acute psychological distress.,Dwight,Season 7,7x11
41701,What are you talking about? You're the one terrorizing me.,Jim,Season 7,7x11
41702,"With snowballs, Jim? With fluffy little snowballs? No. I thought we were just playing.",Dwight,Season 7,7x11
41704,"All this arguing reminds me of a very funny story. You see this on my desk? [he holds up a toy taxi cab] Know who gave me this? My girlfriend Tara, who lives in New York City.",Michael,Season 7,7x11
41705,"Wait, what girlfriend?",Dwight,Season 7,7x11
41706,I haven't told you about her.,Michael,Season 7,7x11
41707,I find that unlikely. You email me when you get a new zit.,Dwight,Season 7,7x11
41708,"I'm a man in my mid-40s and I still get zits. I think that's pretty interesting. But you know what? I am not on trial here. The Scranton strangler is. So, anyway, we have this great weekend, and she drives me to the airport, and we get to JFK, but I am flying out of LaGuardia. So we laugh and laugh and laugh, and then we spend the rest of the day walking around Slo-mo, drinking latte. And at the end of the day, she gives me this, and she says, 'Michael, maybe next time, you should take a cab.'",Michael,Season 7,7x11
41710,I do. She is.,Michael,Season 7,7x11
41711,Did you see her face? Well it seems to me that there is a person sitting out there in the annex that still has feelings for Michael G. Scott. And it ain't Tara.,Michael,Season 7,7x11
41713,Yup.,Pam,Season 7,7x11
41715,"No, no. Jim had a great year, actually. I just wanted to get your opinion.",Pam,Season 7,7x11
41717,Look at this.,Pam,Season 7,7x11
41722,"What happened? What happened? Toby, what did you do? I think Toby's very jealous of all the attention you've been getting.",Michael,Season 7,7x11
41724,"Oh, really? Turn it on me. Well, isn't that nice? Thank you very much.",Michael,Season 7,7x11
41726,It is Christmas.,Michael,Season 7,7x11
41728,"Mmhmm. Mmhmm. Well, the fact that you would think that points to the possibility that it is probably not me. And that I have been framed.",Michael,Season 7,7x11
41730,"Okay, I'm sorry, why are we discounting this whole 'Woody came to life' thing so quickly?",Jim,Season 7,7x11
41731,"Ahhhhhh! [laughs] Surprise! It was part of the party. Pretty funny, huh?",Michael,Season 7,7x11
41733,[laughs] I don't. But someday I think we will laugh about this... when we tell our kids...,Michael,Season 7,7x11
41734,Yikes. [everyone gasps],Jim,Season 7,7x11
41736,Dear God in heaven.,Dwight,Season 7,7x11
41737,"All right. Shh. Okay, you know what? Holly, I didn't mean to do it. It was an accident. An accident borne of jealous feelings.",Michael,Season 7,7x11
41739,"Oh, really? You certainly seemed jealous when I told you about my fake girlfriend. That's what Jim and Dwight thought.",Michael,Season 7,7x11
41740,"Okay, hey, hey, hey...",Dwight,Season 7,7x11
41741,"No, fake girlfriends are always wrong.",Jim,Season 7,7x11
41743,"When you got transferred, and I drove you up to Nashua, you said, 'Michael, I love you, but I can't do this.' But then, with this other guy, you don't have any problem with a long-distance relationship, do you? And you know what, that is what is the matter with me.",Michael,Season 7,7x11
41745,And we did this whole stupid party for you.,Michael,Season 7,7x11
41750,"Mmm. Erin, would you do me a favor and find my street clothes for me, please?",Michael,Season 7,7x11
41752,"[walks over to his desk and sees a present sitting on it, reading the note] 'Hey, Pickles, Merry Christmas. Open immediately. Love, Swiss Cheese.' [opens the present and a snowball shoots out at him, everyone laughs] Damn it, Dwight!",Jim,Season 7,7x11
41753,"Didn't think your affectionate nicknames would be your undoing, did you, Jim? Let that be a lesson to you all.",Dwight,Season 7,7x11
41760,"Jada, Darryl, I'm so glad I found you guys. A grinch stole the star from on top of the Christmas tree and is hiding it in the warehouse somewhere. You want to go help me find him?",Pam,Season 7,7x11
41761,"Oh, my goodness.",Pam,Season 7,7x11
41766,"Something like an obstacle course, Mr. Grinch?",Pam,Season 7,7x11

41796,"Nice to see you again, AJ. Welcome.",Michael,Season 7,7x11
41798,Good trip down?,Michael,Season 7,7x11
41800,"Good, good. Good to see you. Have fun. Enjoy the partay.",Michael,Season 7,7x11
41801,I am dead inside.,Michael,Season 7,7x11
41808,Thank you.,Pam,Season 7,7x11
41840,"[Jim hits a ceiling panel] I don't think he's in the ceiling, babe.",Pam,Season 7,7x11
41841,"Well, uh... I don't think any of us really know. Alright. [Jim hands Pam a present]",Jim,Season 7,7x11
41842,Is it... is it pebbles from that beach in Jamaica? [she shakes it],Pam,Season 7,7x11
41843,"Ooh, go easy with the shaking.",Jim,Season 7,7x11
41844,"[lifting up a diamond bracelet] Oh, my God.",Pam,Season 7,7x11
41845,You like it?,Jim,Season 7,7x11
41846,I love it.,Pam,Season 7,7x11
41847,"Yup, I do make great Christmas gifts. But I couldn't make that.",Jim,Season 7,7x11
41848,"Alright, my turn.",Jim,Season 7,7x11
41849,"Oh, um, it's just, I didn't, I didn't have a lot of time, so that's just a place holder.",Pam,Season 7,7x11
41850,"Right. Of course. [reading the comic book] 'The Adventures of Jimmy Halpert.' Oh, my God. This is awesome! That's my bike. That's my desk. And that is my daughter.",Jim,Season 7,7x11
41851,I mean... [speechless],Jim,Season 7,7x11
41852,"Michael, wait!",Pam,Season 7,7x11
41853,"Oh, hey, hey, no, don't run. You're gonna slip.",Michael,Season 7,7x11
41854,That's good advice.,Pam,Season 7,7x11
41855,"Yup. I read this story about a woman who slipped on some black ice, and she hit her head and went into a coma forever. And then every day, her husband went and visited her in the hospital until she died.",Michael,Season 7,7x11
41856,That's a sad story.,Pam,Season 7,7x11
41857,"[voice breaking] Yeah, well, at least he was married.",Michael,Season 7,7x11
41858,"Oh, okay, Michael, slow down. Everything's gonna be okay.",Pam,Season 7,7x11
41859,"No, it's not. It's not. Oh, man, I can tell you confidently that it is not gonna be okay.",Michael,Season 7,7x11
41860,"I shouldn't tell you this, but... AJ won't commit to Holly. And she's gonna tell him that if he doesn't propose to her by the end of the year, it's over.",Pam,Season 7,7x11
41861,Really?,Michael,Season 7,7x11
41862,"Really. And I don't know about you, but I don't know of a lot of happy marriages that start off with an ultimatum, do you?",Pam,Season 7,7x11
41863,No.,Michael,Season 7,7x11
41864,So just be patient.,Pam,Season 7,7x11
41865,"Yeah. I mean, I can wait till then. Come here. I don't want you to fall.",Michael,Season 7,7x11
41866,I surrender.,Jim,Season 7,7x11
41867,I do not accept your surrender. There's only one way that I would ever relent.,Dwight,Season 7,7x11
41868,Anything. You got it.,Jim,Season 7,7x11
41869,You hit Pam in the face with a snowball while I watch.,Dwight,Season 7,7x11
41870,You're a psychopath.,Jim,Season 7,7x11
41871,I'll take that as a no.,Dwight,Season 7,7x11
41872,"I was in the mall, and I saw that, and I thought it had your name written all over it.",Michael,Season 7,7x11
41874,"No, that's not... no, I went to the mall and I picked that out especially for you.",Michael,Season 7,7x11
41876,[hands Kelly a receipt from his wallet] From the mall. That...,Michael,Season 7,7x11
41878,"Well, that...",Michael,Season 7,7x11
41890,Hey.,Michael,Season 7,7x11
41892,Oh.,Michael,Season 7,7x11
41894,Thank you. A Hostess apple pie! This is my favorite breakfast. How did you know that? Thank you very much.,Michael,Season 7,7x11
41897,"Oh, you know, I seem to remember that Santa promised that he would listen to all the gifts you wanted for Christmas. Didn't he say that?",Michael,Season 7,7x11
41899,I think I know where he is.,Michael,Season 7,7x11
41901,Mmhmm.,Michael,Season 7,7x11
41903,Video games.,Michael,Season 7,7x11
41905,A DSi?,Michael,Season 7,7x11
41907,A horse.,Michael,Season 7,7x11
41909,"You, are you sure you don't want a pony? You want a real horse?",Michael,Season 7,7x11
41911,All right. You have to pick up after them.,Michael,Season 7,7x11

41926,Oh.,Jim,Season 7,7x12
41927,This meeting is for Knights of the Night only.,Dwight,Season 7,7x12
41928,"Knights of the Night are volunteer crime patrollers. We're often compared to the Guardian Angels, but we could not be more different from them. Seriously, we are nothing like the Guardian Angels. I mean, broad strokes purposes, sure. Think Guardian Angels.  One of our many recent good deeds? We set out to capture the Scranton Strangler. Mission accomplished. Not by us.",Dwight,Season 7,7x12
41929,"I'm actually just looking for my Blackberry, so, carry on.",Jim,Season 7,7x12

41933,"I'm just looking for my phone, so... pretend I'm not here.",Jim,Season 7,7x12
41934,"Fine. Minutes from previous meeting of Knights of the Night. That's our official name, Jim.",Dwight,Season 7,7x12
41935,Sounds good.,Jim,Season 7,7x12
41936,Reflective strips were glued to patrol jackets. Knights went outside with flashlights to test them.,Dwight,Season 7,7x12
41937,Smart.,Jim,Season 7,7x12

42725,With that I can buy... half the menu.,Michael,Season 7,7x14
42727,All right. What do you do with the hog dogs that you don't sell?,Michael,Season 7,7x14

42809,"Not you, Erin.",Dwight,Season 7,7x14
42811,That is the stupidest idea I've ever heard. No. Tap into your common mind and tell us what he would do next.,Dwight,Season 7,7x14
42814,"Right.  I can do this on my own. I can think like Michael. All right... I'm deep below the ocean's surface in a submarine. A torpedo's coming right at me. No. Damn it, that's just my own imagination.  Maybe he's bowling.",Dwight,Season 7,7x14

42989,Okay. Fine. No more PDA.,Michael,Season 7,7x15
42991,You win. But here's what we are going to do. We are going to designate one of our closets as a hook-up zone.,Michael,Season 7,7x15
42993,Anything goes.,Michael,Season 7,7x15
42995,"Michael, that's absurd. What if two couples want to go at the same time?",Dwight,Season 7,7x15
42996,"Okay, then we have two closets. No, no, we're gonna have three closets, one for each base, no homers. Yes?",Michael,Season 7,7x15

42999,Yes!,Dwight,Season 7,7x15

43003,Mm-hmm.,Jim,Season 7,7x15
43004,"You know, you're in a meeting, and nobody knows that you've had sex there, except for you and him.",Pam,Season 7,7x15
43005,[snorts] Ew.,Jim,Season 7,7x15
43032,"Ah, the old 'leave behind.' Oldest trick in the book. Good thing it's working.",Michael,Season 7,7x15
43034,"Since when is comfort the most important thing? I mean, I don't... I don't sit on your lap because it's comfortable. I sit on your lap because I like the way your thighs feel on my butt.",Michael,Season 7,7x15
43036,"Oh. Okay. Well, if it makes you uncomfortable, then we'll stop.",Michael,Season 7,7x15
43038,Holly and I are like Romeo and Juliet. And this office is like the dragon that kept them apart.,Michael,Season 7,7x15

43041,I love you.,Michael,Season 7,7x15
43043,I love you-love you.,Michael,Season 7,7x15

43062,"Well, we were just looking for Ryan, so he's not here.",Jim,Season 7,7x15
43064,"Oh, yeah, we were. We were just looking to say hi. So hey.",Pam,Season 7,7x15
43066,"No, we weren't.",Pam,Season 7,7x15
43068,No.,Pam,Season 7,7x15
43069,Definitely not. That's disgusting.,Jim,Season 7,7x15
43071,"Hey, you don't have to...",Jim,Season 7,7x15
43072,That was so embarrassing. I'm gonna die.,Pam,Season 7,7x15
43073,That was really rough.,Jim,Season 7,7x15
43074,Let me make something clear. Jim and I have never and will never have sex in the office.,Pam,Season 7,7x15
43075,"No, because the office isn't what I'd consider a romantic place.",Jim,Season 7,7x15
43076,"Besides, we have something those other people don't have, which is a home and a bed.",Pam,Season 7,7x15
43077,And a shower.,Jim,Season 7,7x15
43078,"Hello, Holly.",Michael,Season 7,7x15
43080,"Here, shake. No!",Michael,Season 7,7x15

43090,I don't know what your body feels like 'cause I can't touch it.,Michael,Season 7,7x15
43093,Grab you here.,Michael,Season 7,7x15
43095,I will grab you here anyway. [laughs],Michael,Season 7,7x15
43098,Never.,Michael,Season 7,7x15
43100,"I did say I would, but I was wrong. I can't stop. You don't what it is like to love a woman and have her love you back. It is a feeling that cannot and will not, and frankly, cannot be contained.",Michael,Season 7,7x15

43170,"Ladies and gentlemen, I have an announcement to make. As of today, officially, Holly and I are moving into together. Yay! [claps] Thank you. Thank you. Oscar, this must be tough for you, watching this go down. You could not stand in the way of true love, my friend!",Michael,Season 7,7x15
43173,"Well, the point is, there will no longer be any need for PDA here at the office between us because, when we get home, we are going to make love to and with one another, and that, to me, is the best Valentine's Day present that a person could receive. So I bid you all adieu.",Michael,Season 7,7x15

43190,Erin... what are you doing?,Michael,Season 7,7x16
43192,"That's... That's. Well, don't put words in my mouth.",Michael,Season 7,7x16
43193,Threat Level: Midnight is the great lost film of Michael Scott.,Jim,Season 7,7x16

43195,"Yeah, if Michael Scott did your home movie!",Jim,Season 7,7x16
43196,"Michael screened a work in progress for us, years ago, and it didn't go well. We thought it was a comedy. [flashback clip of Michael angrily leaving the conference room while the whole office is laughing at the tv] Everything pointed to it being a comedy.",Pam,Season 7,7x16
43197,We'd love to see it!,Pam,Season 7,7x16
43198,"Sweet, I will go invite Holly.",Michael,Season 7,7x16
43199,"Okay everyone, I know we're really excited to see this movie that everybody's in, but we have to remember that Michael is sensitive, so let's stay positive! And no laughing, no comments, just positive energy and we'll have a pure fun day! Okay?",Pam,Season 7,7x16
43202,"Mhmm! It's got action, it's got heart, it's got some bosom.",Michael,Season 7,7x16

43206,"Ladies and gentleman, Threat Level: Midnight. [applause]",Michael,Season 7,7x16
43207,"I play Samuel, Michael Scarn's robot butler. I wanted Samuel's voice- [robot impression] to be like this! [normally] But Michael thought that Samuel should be a very advance android, almost indistinguishable from a real person.",Dwight,Season 7,7x16
43208,Dwight does not play a robot.,Michael,Season 7,7x16
43210,I did not love the dialogue. Or the character.  I took the role to impress a receptionist who will remain nameless.,Jim,Season 7,7x16
43211,He cut the part where my circuit board malfunctioned! What was the point of spilling the drink on me?,Dwight,Season 7,7x16
43213,"By far and away, the most expensive shot in the movie. But, it was integral to the story.",Michael,Season 7,7x16
43214,That was not scripted.,Michael,Season 7,7x16
43216,"[cracking up at the stupidity of it, the rest of the office besides Michael and Holly are concealing their laughter. Pam Is trying to quiet Jim up] Sorry.",Jim,Season 7,7x16
43217,"[turns off the movie from the remote, the office complains]",Michael,Season 7,7x16
43218,"I'm sorry, I'm really, really sorry. I think I was just relieved, to see that Michael Scarn got his confidence back.",Jim,Season 7,7x16
43223,"[to Holly] Well that's a... pretty good reaction. [Holly nods] Pretty cool, right? Did you like it? Did you like that?",Michael,Season 7,7x16
43225,"Okay. [Stands up and leaves the conference room to the dismay of the office] No, it's not good enough. It's not good enough...",Michael,Season 7,7x16

43229,"Mmmm, good? Everybody out there says it's great!",Michael,Season 7,7x16
43231,Did you? What did you love about it?,Michael,Season 7,7x16
43233,"No, no. Holly, this isn't Ocean's Eleven, where you get together with all your friends and just have fun and don't care about how it turns out. What'd you really think, honestly.",Michael,Season 7,7x16
43235,"Is it, is it because you're afraid of where this is gonna take me? See, because I need you... to keep me grounded.",Michael,Season 7,7x16
43237,"[angrily] It was eleven years, okay? This has been my dream for eleven years, and if you don't think it's great than you're basically saying that you don't believe in my dream.",Michael,Season 7,7x16
43239,"I talk about a lot of things, Holly! I was eventually gonna get around to my dream! Obviously! Eleven years I could've been working on the Scarn Nebulus.",Michael,Season 7,7x16
43241,"Because, if I don't have this, what do I have? I have nothing.",Michael,Season 7,7x16
43243,"I have my book on business, Somehow I Manage. I have my HBO comedy special, Here I Go Again dot-dot-dot. But you know what? When I think about it, when I really think about it, none of those things are as real to me as my movie.",Michael,Season 7,7x16

43247,"I am a huge Woody Allen fan. Although I've only seen Antz, but I'll tell you something. What I respect about that man, is that when he was going through all that stuff that came out in the press, about how Antz was just a rip-off of A Bug's Life, he stayed true to his films.  Or at least the film that I saw which again was Antz. The thing is... I thought Bug's Life was better, much better. Than Ants. The point is, don't listen to your critics, listen to your fans.",Michael,Season 7,7x16
43248,Who likes Threat Level: Midnight? [applause from the office] Okay then who wants to watch the rest?! [everyone yells approval],Michael,Season 7,7x16

43250,"[he office shushes Michael to hear the movie better] That's fine, it's great!",Jim,Season 7,7x16
43251,"No, no! Actually it's really screwed up because they [chuckles], they were trying to qualify, they were disqualified, they had to forfeit the game. Undefeated season. That's why there were so many people there. [Michael stands up, clearly realizing that his movie is not as great as he thought]",Michael,Season 7,7x16
43252,Hey...,Michael,Season 7,7x16
43254,"No it's not. [kisses Holly while smiling] It's not. But, they really seem to be enjoying it.",Michael,Season 7,7x16

43258,Oh yeah! [laughs] Yes he is!,Michael,Season 7,7x16
43259,"No no, he's doing it to catch the president!",Dwight,Season 7,7x16
43260,"No, no Dwight. He's just being stupid. [the office laughs]",Michael,Season 7,7x16
43261,I have the best survival stock shelter in north eastern Pennsylvania. But everything has a shelf-life. So I must eat and replace everything that's about to expire. It's nice not to have to plan my meals.,Dwight,Season 7,7x17
43263,They're still good for another week.,Dwight,Season 7,7x17
43266,"Hardy har har. Okay picture this: Snowy ash drizzles from the sky. A ravenous pack of dogs surrounds you as the flame at the end of your stick dies out. There's only one hope left for you. The door to my shelter. You pound, you beg, Dwight! Please let me in! But I ignore your cries and do not let you in. You wanna know why?",Dwight,Season 7,7x17
43267,"Because of the sign, that says no pounding no begging.",Jim,Season 7,7x17
43268,"No. Because you laughed at me. Kevin will be eaten! Pam will be taken slave! Jim will be made a warlord's gesture. Meredith will do ok. Be assured this day will come. It's just a matter of time. Could be one month, could be two months.",Dwight,Season 7,7x17
43269,Three months.,Jim,Season 7,7x17
43270,Could be.,Dwight,Season 7,7x17
43271,Four months.,Jim,Season 7,7x17
43272,"I can see that happening, yes.",Dwight,Season 7,7x17
43273,Eight months?,Jim,Season 7,7x17
43274,That's a realistic time line.,Dwight,Season 7,7x17
43275,[Pam kisses Jim on the cheek] Eleven months.,Jim,Season 7,7x17
43276,Perhaps.,Dwight,Season 7,7x17
43277,Okay now really think hard about this one:  One year.,Jim,Season 7,7x17
43278,I can see that as a very real possibility.,Dwight,Season 7,7x17
43279,"[time has obviously passed, as everyone is gone except Jim and Dwight] Four hundred and ninety-four months?",Jim,Season 7,7x17
43280,I can see that happening.,Dwight,Season 7,7x17

43283,Still not seeing the problem here.,Michael,Season 7,7x17

43293,"Oh, yes yes yes yes. Just so you know, he's at his funniest when you've given him five shots.",Michael,Season 7,7x17
43295,And it also helps if you've had five shots.,Michael,Season 7,7x17
43297,Whoa!,Michael,Season 7,7x17
43298,[to Michael] Why is Packer back?,Jim,Season 7,7x17

43304,"[sees Holly and Todd shaking hands in the conference room] Yes! The Pack is back! Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to introduce you to a man who needs no introduction, probably because most of you have done it with him. Just kidding he wouldn't be interested in any of you. In all seriousness, Todd Packer, is a permanent salesman at this branch. And I would like to invite you to welcome him with open arms.",Michael,Season 7,7x17
43306,What!?,Jim,Season 7,7x17
43309,"You did! You got burned, because Packer's back! Packer is turning in his car for a desk. He is turning in his condoms, for a condominium! Although he's probably going to have to use condoms from here on out.",Michael,Season 7,7x17
43310,"[seething] Holly, you approved this?",Dwight,Season 7,7x17
43312,You did approve it?,Jim,Season 7,7x17
43319,"I got Erin a new computer, because the one at reception sucked. I should know. And I don't wanna say the other one was old, but its I.P. number is one! [laughs sheepishly] Right?",Pam,Season 7,7x17

43327,I didn't order anything.,Dwight,Season 7,7x17
43328,And I don't have anything for you. But I do wanna talk to you about something. We have been thinking about where Packer should sit... And we can't just sit around and wait for Creed to die.,Michael,Season 7,7x17
43329,Well there's a lot of seats in the annex.,Dwight,Season 7,7x17
43330,"So you wouldn't mind permanently relocating, so that Packer can take this desk here. [Jim looks appalled]",Michael,Season 7,7x17
43332,"I have been sitting here for ten years, Michael.",Dwight,Season 7,7x17
43334,No it is not.,Dwight,Season 7,7x17

43368,You have a computer Andy.,Pam,Season 7,7x17
43370,"Ok, but listen. We just don't have the budget for it. Okay? Reception needed a computer so we got one.",Pam,Season 7,7x17
43372,"Yes, but Reception is a one person department. If I get you a new computer I have to get one for everyone in sales. For Dwight, for Stanley, it would be crazy.",Pam,Season 7,7x17
43377,"See, this is what I'm talking about.",Pam,Season 7,7x17
43379,Sorry Andy.,Pam,Season 7,7x17

43435,[continues working],Jim,Season 7,7x17
43436,"[walks towards Todd] Hey Packer, I made you some hot chocolate.",Dwight,Season 7,7x17
43438,Cause I wanna let bygones be bygones. Show you I'm cool. You're the new guy. It's cold out. I made too much. I got this awesome hot chocolate recipe from my wife.,Dwight,Season 7,7x17
43439,That's a lot of reasons! [suspicious],Jim,Season 7,7x17
43440,Drink it!,Dwight,Season 7,7x17
43442,[interrupts Dwight trying to force feed Todd] Can I talk to you a second?,Jim,Season 7,7x17
43443,"So, this hot chocolate thing.",Jim,Season 7,7x17
43444,None of your business.,Dwight,Season 7,7x17
43445,"Well, you know you can't actually poison him.",Jim,Season 7,7x17
43446,"It wasn't poison Jim, it was a laxative. People take laxatives all the time. This is just, a lot more of a laxative. Let me handle this.",Dwight,Season 7,7x17
43447,I really think we should join forces on this one.,Jim,Season 7,7x17

43452,"Pepto-Bismol, in his hot chocolate.",Dwight,Season 7,7x17
43453,"You've gotta stop with the hot chocolate stuff. I was thinking we can jam his drawers, so they only comes out two inches, then he can see everything in them but he can't get to them.",Jim,Season 7,7x17
43454,[mocking] Ooh does Edgar Allan Poe know about that one? So sinister! That wouldn't annoy a person at all! Where do you come up with this stuff?,Dwight,Season 7,7x17
43455,"Okay! Well this isn't my best, but call Froggy101, say that we're the tour manager for Justin Bieber, and we're giving away free tickets, we give him a number to call for the tickets, and it's his own number.",Jim,Season 7,7x17
43456,Who is Justice Beaver?,Dwight,Season 7,7x17
43457,He... It's a crime fighting beaver.,Jim,Season 7,7x17
43458,Why don't you write up your best forty ideas and e-mail them to me. Can you do that?,Dwight,Season 7,7x17
43459,"Absolutely, I'll e-mail you a hundred.",Jim,Season 7,7x17
43460,"Yeah, write up your list of one hundred, edit it down to your top forty, then e-mail it to me, and I'll read it over.",Dwight,Season 7,7x17
43462,I don't know if there's really a private place in this office.,Pam,Season 7,7x17

43466,Okay. [walks to conference room with Andy and stares at the sign up sheet with wonder] When did people sign-,Pam,Season 7,7x17
43468,"Well what was I supposed to do, let you walk all over me?",Pam,Season 7,7x17
43470,"Okay, well I didn't think about it like that. It's just, I can't do anything about it. I can't replace that one unless that computer breaks.",Pam,Season 7,7x17
43472,"Yeah, well if it breaks all the way I can get you a new one.",Pam,Season 7,7x17

43478,One thirty-five. Did you like one thirty-five?,Jim,Season 7,7x17
43479,"Eat a brog. Maybe it's because I didn't understand it. I just had a couple of notes, let me grab a pen. [Dwight tries to open up a drawer on his desk but it only goes out two inches] Damn it. Gah! Just when we were getting going.",Dwight,Season 7,7x17
43482,"And you made Hank smile, that doesn't happen often. You're very charming. That is something you should take upstairs, and use on people that really matter. [Hank looks irritated again]",Michael,Season 7,7x17

43801,That... that's impossible.,Dwight,Season 7,7x18
43802,"It is right. I mean, it's impossible.",Jim,Season 7,7x18
43803,"All right, I'll take them.",Dwight,Season 7,7x18
43804,They're probably worthless.,Jim,Season 7,7x18

43822,"Through these blinds is where I first saw you, and you had all these boxes, and I thought you were the prettiest mover I had ever seen. And I was sitting at this desk when I called you to tell you that I had herpes and that I was still in love with you and you said that it was over, and that you didn't love me. Thank goodness none of that was true. Including the herpes.",Michael,Season 7,7x18

45384,How is this on me?,Pam,Season 7,7x24
45385,Hang up. [Creed hangs up] Corporate needs you to find the differences between this picture and this picture. [shows Creed two similar-looking photos of some building] Intel has told us there were at least seven.,Pam,Season 7,7x24
45387,They're the same picture.,Pam,Season 7,7x24

45407,No.,Jim,Season 7,7x24
45408,"Now, listen,...",Dwight,Season 7,7x24
45409,"You're not getting an interview, Dwight. The whole point of this Search Committee process is to prevent hiring someone like you ever again.",Jim,Season 7,7x24
45410,"Okay, I know why you're saying that, Jim, I really do, but think of it this way. The hand that reaches from the grave to grip your throat [motions to grip Jim's throat] is the strong hand you want on the wheel.",Dwight,Season 7,7x24
45411,[pulls Dwight's arm down] Okay. That's vivid.,Jim,Season 7,7x24
45412,"I'm going to make you an offer. Okay? You even do so little as grant me an interview, I will guarantee you your dream work life. Okay? You roll in at 10 a.m. to your own private reserved parking spot, pick up your daily free coffee from Dwight's Caffeine Corner, unlimited sex breaks for you and Pam...",Dwight,Season 7,7x24
45413,Yikes.,Jim,Season 7,7x24

45416,Ha ha! [pats Jim on the back],Dwight,Season 7,7x24
45417,"Unfortunately, Jo also took the job away from you because she doesn't trust your judgment. So how would that look for me, if I recommended you?",Jim,Season 7,7x24
45418,"Fine. I'll do it without you, but you'll regret this.",Dwight,Season 7,7x24
45419,Okay.,Jim,Season 7,7x24
45420,Let me get that for you. [runs ahead to open the door for Jim],Dwight,Season 7,7x24
45421,Thank you.,Jim,Season 7,7x24
45422,Okay. [looks ashamed],Dwight,Season 7,7x24
45424,"The Senator? [Oscar nods] He was married before, and he has a kid.",Pam,Season 7,7x24

45430,The windowless building by the Baskin Robbins.,Pam,Season 7,7x24
45432,Forget it. I'm never gonna know what goes on there.,Pam,Season 7,7x24
45434,You're in the gay mafia.,Pam,Season 7,7x24
45437,No.,Pam,Season 7,7x24
45451,Great.,Jim,Season 7,7x24
45453,I'm sure it's fine.,Jim,Season 7,7x24

45459,He's an amazing man. He's a Rhodes Scholar. He invented an app that invents apps. Fantastic kisser...,Jim,Season 7,7x24
45461,Darryl! We all know you. Your interview is not nearly as important as the other guys. [Darryl taps a couple times on Jim's desk and walks away],Jim,Season 7,7x24
45467,"That's very interesting. Um, I feel like there might be a conflict there, and if a conflict did arise, how would that be dealt with?",Jim,Season 7,7x24
45473,I think that's probably all we need to hear from...,Jim,Season 7,7x24
45475,That's very...,Jim,Season 7,7x24
45480,You know what? They all just sort of blend together after a while.,Jim,Season 7,7x24
45482,"No, not at all. In fact, I'm not even taking it seriously. I think at the end of the day, I'm just gonna pick a name out of the hat.",Jim,Season 7,7x24
45487,Uh--,Jim,Season 7,7x24
45489,"Okay, everybody, I was just making a joke. I am taking it seriously, I promise.",Jim,Season 7,7x24
45495,"No, was it good?",Jim,Season 7,7x24
45502,"[clears throat] Jo, may I speak to you for a second?",Dwight,Season 7,7x24
45504,"Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ohh, I enjoy laughing at my mistakes, because I've learned so much from them. I'd like to be interviewed for the position.",Dwight,Season 7,7x24
45506,Okay.,Dwight,Season 7,7x24

45540,"[seeing Dwight wearing sunglasses and whose face and hands are completely covered in gauze] Oh, I know this guy. [Dwight awkwardly hands copies of his resume to the Search Committee] Hello!

45544,What is it?,Jim,Season 7,7x24
45545,[in a cheesy French accent] Assistant Regional Manager.,Dwight,Season 7,7x24
45546,"Oh, that's my mistake, sorry about that. The last paper company you worked for burned to the ground? And all because they wouldn't hire a manager who lived and breathed paper? That's a travesty.",Jim,Season 7,7x24
45548,Uhh. Wait. Wait! No. Stop! Stop. Jo... [takes off sunglasses and reveals his face] It's me. I'm Dwight.,Dwight,Season 7,7x24

45554,"I would have dressed this way every day, legally changed my name, learned French sign language, shown up, and been the best damn branch manager you'd ever seen!",Dwight,Season 7,7x24
45556,Yes.,Dwight,Season 7,7x24
45558,"This guy was good. Although, he did keep saying that he needed two weeks off right at the beginning for a trip to the finger lakes. Seriously. Every five minutes, he was like, 'just making sure the finger lakes thing is clear.'",Jim,Season 7,7x24
45560,Finger Lakes guy is good. Darryl is also very good.,Jim,Season 7,7x24
45570,Um... why Kelly?,Jim,Season 7,7x24

45574,"Oh, I didn't know you knew her?",Jim,Season 7,7x24
45576,No.,Jim,Season 7,7x24
45578,"You know, she also gave me a reason to think that maybe she wasn't a good fit.",Jim,Season 7,7x24
45590,Silence?,Dwight,Season 7,7x24
45601,That was our dream wedding.,Pam,Season 7,7x24

45610,I demand more questions!,Dwight,Season 7,7x24
45611,"[ignoring Dwight] All right, guys, good day, a lot of candidates. Let's discuss.",Jim,Season 7,7x24
45612,"Okay! If you're not going to interview me, then I'll do it.",Dwight,Season 7,7x24
45613,Yes.,Jim,Season 7,7x24
45614,"What will be your first priority? I will have seven first priorities. Safety, profits, fostering a community of self-reliance and entrepreneurship, listening, respect for human life, bolstering our public image, and... [chuckles] getting everyone home on time. Dwight, let me be frank. In an accident that no one can blame you for, an antique gun was discharged while you were acting manager. How are we ever to trust you again? [whispering] That's a great question. [Jim nods] I am going to institute a strict no-firearms policy for this office that extends to myself as well. Wow. All of my concerns are disappearing.",Dwight,Season 7,7x24
45615,"Thank you, Dwight.",Jim,Season 7,7x24
45616,"Thank you. [clears throat and gets up] You'll be hearing from us shortly, Mr. Schrute, and I think you're gonna like the call you're going to receive. [smiles] Oh, come on. I'm just happy that I got this meeting. [leaves]",Dwight,Season 7,7x24

45619,He's not a real candidate.,Jim,Season 7,7x24
45621,You took the deal.,Jim,Season 7,7x24
45623,That's not okay.,Jim,Season 7,7x24
45626,What is happening right now?,Jim,Season 7,7x24
45628,"No, why would you think that?",Jim,Season 7,7x24
45630,"Okay. [walks out of conference room] Okay, guys, just so you all know, no decision has been made, and Dwight is definitely not the boss.",Jim,Season 7,7x24
45632,"No, no, no. Not ever, 'cause that's not gonna happen.",Jim,Season 7,7x24
45633,"Well, it's not entirely up to you, is it? Seems to me like someone's getting a little power-mad.",Dwight,Season 7,7x24
45634,Am I the only one who remembers what he did when he was in charge? I feel like I'm going a little bit crazy.,Jim,Season 7,7x24
45636,Thank you.,Jim,Season 7,7x24
45638,"Okay, seems like everybody has an opinion. So, who else? Anybody?",Jim,Season 7,7x24
45640,[while sighing] I suppose I am.,Jim,Season 7,7x24
45647,Yes.,Jim,Season 7,7x24

45667,"Ohh, hey Gabe, I'm sorry, we... we didn't get you a cake or anything. We're gonna miss you.",Pam,Season 7,7x24
45676,"We're gonna miss you, Gabe. [Gabe leaves]",Dwight,Season 7,7x24
45681,"What about Darryl? We can all agree that he's a stand-up guy, right?",Jim,Season 7,7x24
45691,"What? No, no, it's not a vote.",Jim,Season 7,7x24
45693,I don't know. This conversation really got away from me.,Jim,Season 7,7x24
45695,"No, they can't. That's not how this is gonna work. [exhales] We're going in this room, we're going to have a meeting. We're gonna make a recommendation to Jo, and she's gonna give you her recommendation on Monday. Okay? [to Kelly and Toby, as they re-enter the conference room] What the hell happened out there? [Kevin tries to follow, but the door is closed on him]",Jim,Season 7,7x24
45703,"I will run this branch, or I will destroy this branch, or... [shrugs] I don't know. Something always works out. [leaves]",Dwight,Season 7,7x24

45707,"Well, okay!",Pam,Season 7,7x24
45719,"No, I insist.",Dwight,Season 8,8x1
45721,"The Search Committee finally decided, after a lot of deliberation, on Robert California, for the manager position. Who took one look around and left. He drove down to Florida and convinced Joe to make him CEO... CEO... her own job. He talked her out of her own job. And I don't really know how someone does that. But, anyway, then the position was his to fill.And he chose",Jim,Season 8,8x1
45726,K... Kevin! [Kevin planking on Dwight's desk],Dwight,Season 8,8x1
45727,"Yeah, at first, I was really disappointed, but I've got a great daily routine going right now. I have upped my karate to eight times a week. I've added boxing - lunches and on weekends. I do kickboxing three times a week. Krav Maga four times a week. An hour of meditation every morning at sunrise and again at sunset. So yeah, I'm doin' great.",Dwight,Season 8,8x1
45728,"K, I'm gonna need some help. Pam?",Dwight,Season 8,8x1

45732,"No, I told you I don't like that joke. It is a boy. We found out early.",Jim,Season 8,8x1
45733,Much different the second time around. And I have to say; it is nice not being the only pregnant woman in the office.,Pam,Season 8,8x1

45737,"Well, I am a few months ahead of you.",Pam,Season 8,8x1

45748,"You watching that commercial again? [Pam nods] Why do you keep watching it, if you know it's just gonna make you cry?",Jim,Season 8,8x1
45749,"Because everything makes me cry, so what's the difference? This dog, he just wants to protect his bone.",Pam,Season 8,8x1
45750,He's got a bank vault. That's a start.,Jim,Season 8,8x1
45751,Not enough though.,Pam,Season 8,8x1
45752,"The new CEO works out of the conference room about half the time. But whenever he takes a break, he does these weird walks around the office. And you never know who he's gonna zero in on for these really intense small-talks. You just hope it's not you. And yet, you hope it is you too. It's strange.",Jim,Season 8,8x1

46018,"K, Kevin, are you saying 'See the world'? or 'Sea World?'",Jim,Season 8,8x2
46020,"No, see? Right there, that's the problem with your method. 'Cause I still don't know if you're saying 'Sea World' or 'see the world,' and it's taking a lot of time to explain it.",Jim,Season 8,8x2

46182,"I don't know, for such a crazy number I'd like something pretty crazy.",Jim,Season 8,8x2

46286,I don't like that clip.,Pam,Season 8,8x2

46361,"I know what you'd do with all that money. [imitating Jim] 'Hey Pam, let's buy expensive bathrobes and hug.'",Dwight,Season 8,8x3
46362,"No, I'd probably buy a big piece of land in Maine, build a house, work in town. Somewhere I could bike to or kayak to. I'd either bike to my job at the kayak shop or kayak to my job at the bike shop.",Jim,Season 8,8x3
46363,"And then on the weekends, would you hacky sack back to reality and spend time with your wife and kids?",Pam,Season 8,8x3
46364,Whoa. Saucy. I thought you liked Maine?,Jim,Season 8,8x3
46365,I think we should get a townhouse in SoHo...,Pam,Season 8,8x3

46369,And then my handsome husband...,Pam,Season 8,8x3
46370,Which ideally would be me....,Jim,Season 8,8x3
46371,Would bring me a flavored coffee.,Pam,Season 8,8x3

46373,Well in your fantasy we're Stephen King characters.,Pam,Season 8,8x3
46374,"I don't know about Stephen King, I mean...",Jim,Season 8,8x3

46420,Nice. [Dwight runs forklift into wall of warehouse] Whoa whoa whoa whoa! Oh!,Jim,Season 8,8x3
46422,Yup.,Dwight,Season 8,8x3
46442,[Grunts while lifting box into truck] What's the problem? Grunting is scientifically proven to add more power. Ask any female tennis player. Or her husband. [Erin grunts loudly and tosses box toward truck but misses],Dwight,Season 8,8x3
46454,No.,Pam,Season 8,8x3
46456,"Uh, buying lottery tickets online. [Ryan laughs]",Pam,Season 8,8x3
46458,"You came in at 10:30 today, right?",Pam,Season 8,8x3
46466,There's gotta be a better way to do this. This is literally how they built the pyramids.,Jim,Season 8,8x3
46467,"Well, they whipped people which was helpful. But you're right. We should be able to find a more efficient way of moving boxes than Madge or Heday.",Dwight,Season 8,8x3
46468,Yeah [laughs and then notices camera] Not that they're not smart people.,Jim,Season 8,8x3
46469,"[Noticing camera] No, no. Very smart. Uh, theirs is more of a physical intelligence.",Dwight,Season 8,8x3
46470,I'd go with that.,Jim,Season 8,8x3

46499,Our fake winnings,Jim,Season 8,8x3
46500,"And we move to the south of France. See? No, there's plenty of bicycling for you. I think that's where they do the Tour de France.",Pam,Season 8,8x3
46501,"It is, yeah. I mean I just don't know why I'm compromising if it's my fantasy. Cause in my fantasy it's Maine and you love it.",Jim,Season 8,8x3
46502,"Because I'm never gonna act like that, even in your fantasy.",Pam,Season 8,8x3
46503,"Nope. You're, you're doing a great job of it in my fantasy right now. [Pam sighs]",Jim,Season 8,8x3

46517,Kevin Costner.,Dwight,Season 8,8x3
46518,Yeah. [Shot shows Kevin and Erin greasing floor of warehouse],Jim,Season 8,8x3
46521,"So, it's not the dumbest idea.",Jim,Season 8,8x3
46522,It's not the greatest one either...,Dwight,Season 8,8x3
46523,"But, the fact remains we gotta move these boxes.",Jim,Season 8,8x3
46524,And it's clear we're not going to carry them. [Dwight grunts loudly in shot showing them sliding boxes over the greased floor],Dwight,Season 8,8x3
46525,"So sadly, it's the best idea on the table.",Jim,Season 8,8x3
46526,Exactly.,Dwight,Season 8,8x3
46528,Is he OK?,Jim,Season 8,8x3
46529,Yep. He'll be fine.,Dwight,Season 8,8x3
46561,"Uh, it's not totally empty.",Dwight,Season 8,8x3
46563,"OK, I can see why you're angry, you're coming into this cold. But believe me a lot of thought went into this.",Dwight,Season 8,8x3
46566,"OK, alright, that's...look. All we were trying to do is we thought we could come up with a more efficient way to do things.",Jim,Season 8,8x3
46569,I don't know.,Dwight,Season 8,8x3
46571,That's alright.,Jim,Season 8,8x3
46573,"Doesn't matter what the name is. Se��or Loadenstein, that's stupid.",Jim,Season 8,8x3

46579,"OK. You know what? It's been a real busy day, what do you say we put all this away.",Dwight,Season 8,8x3
46581,"It's uh, it's in beta testing.",Dwight,Season 8,8x3
46583,"Get the thing, go! Lube it up, Kevin! Start mopping.",Dwight,Season 8,8x3
46588,We came to an agreement. We're going to live in a stunning pre-war brownstone at the top of a mountain.,Pam,Season 8,8x3
46589,Right. It's city and country combined.,Jim,Season 8,8x3
46590,Just a subway stop away are the best museums in the world.,Pam,Season 8,8x3
46591,And I can fish right from the window of Pam's pottery studio. And we can chat any time we want.,Jim,Season 8,8x3
46592,Just like now.,Pam,Season 8,8x3
46593,[laughs] Just like now....too bad the schools are terrible.,Jim,Season 8,8x3
46594,Oh..,Pam,Season 8,8x3
46595,But what are you gonna do about that?,Jim,Season 8,8x3
46596,What are you gonna do?,Pam,Season 8,8x3
46600,"Ok, ok. We are so close. All we have to do is figure out that corner and we're basically there.",Jim,Season 8,8x3
46601,"I know. Kevin, we've been friends for a long time, right?",Dwight,Season 8,8x3
46603,So if I was to ask you to sacrifice your body and lay down on a greasy corner and act as a human bumper shield-,Dwight,Season 8,8x3
46604,"Ok, Dwight! Come on. Here, I think I have an idea.",Jim,Season 8,8x3
46605,"I wouldn't be asking you lightly, now would I?",Dwight,Season 8,8x3
46607,"Right. Now do you wanna wear a trash bag, er...",Dwight,Season 8,8x3
46608,Dammit Dwight!,Jim,Season 8,8x3
46610,"Ok, I have a question. Why is the truck so far away?",Jim,Season 8,8x3
46613,"Ok, I just asked that ques-, I don't know. I mean it seems like the door is huge, right? So you should be able to back the truck up to the paper.",Jim,Season 8,8x3
46614,"Yeah, why is it so far away Jim?",Dwight,Season 8,8x3
46615,So this warehouse has been around for what? Like a thousand years? And they never thought to back the truck up into it? I guess sometimes it just takes a fresh set of eyes. Alright! [knocks on side of truck],Jim,Season 8,8x3
46619,Whoa whoa whoa!,Jim,Season 8,8x3
46623,"No! Stop! Stop stop stop stop! You're way over! Ok, you gotta cut it! Cut it hard! (bleep!) Stop stop stop stop! Stop, stop! Dammit Dwight. Great.",Jim,Season 8,8x3

46632,"Andy, somebody defaced it.",Pam,Season 8,8x4
46634,"There's this thing that people tend to do with billboards. How do I put this? If there's an opportunity for a graffiti artist to work in a... phallic shape, interacting with the artwork, it'll happen, and Andy gave them that opportunity.",Jim,Season 8,8x4
46641,"Okay, don't be gross.",Jim,Season 8,8x4
46642,[entering office] What's going on?,Dwight,Season 8,8x4

46683,There's so much more to it than that.,Dwight,Season 8,8x4
46684,"I've been wanting Schrute Farms to break into the high-end event hosting industry for some time, and this party is a great opportunity. Plus, I've got a secret weapon. [holds up book, Throwing A Garden Party by James Trickington] Only one copy in the world and some sucker on the internet sold it to me for two dollars. [laughs]",Dwight,Season 8,8x4
46685,I'm actually really disappointed in how poorly my book is doing. [holds up same book] I've only sold one copy.,Jim,Season 8,8x4

47566,You doubt it?,Pam,Season 8,8x7
47567,What's that?,Jim,Season 8,8x7
47568,Why do you doubt that she's single?,Pam,Season 8,8x7
47569,Honestly I have no idea. I just figured we'd save her from Ryan right?,Jim,Season 8,8x7
47581,It's going to be good to have someone hot at Pam's desk huh?,Pam,Season 8,8x7
47583,I'm kidding! Oh my gosh you guys! She's obviously super cute I get it. But I'd like to point out there's 50 pounds more of me to love if that's your thing.,Pam,Season 8,8x7
47586,Thank you. Really you guys thank you. Very sweet.,Pam,Season 8,8x7
47589,Really well thank you all.,Pam,Season 8,8x7
47593,Ok ok ok no no no. This is disgusting. You realize what you're saying? The hottest thing ever would be a 66 year old pregnant woman.,Dwight,Season 8,8x7
47595,No! There are universal biological standards of beauty and attraction. And you are purposefully celebrating the opposite of them to mollycoddle a pregnant woman.,Dwight,Season 8,8x7
47597,Yes you are. And another thing. Helen Mirren was born Helen Mironov. That's right. You're fake salivating over a Soviet era Russian.,Dwight,Season 8,8x7
47623,Hey.,Pam,Season 8,8x7
47624,Hey.,Jim,Season 8,8x7
47625,Helen Mirren. Hot?,Pam,Season 8,8x7
47626,Yeah. Super pretty.,Jim,Season 8,8x7
47627,Huh. What about Cathy?,Pam,Season 8,8x7
47628,The temp?,Jim,Season 8,8x7
47629,Yeah. Do you think she's hot?,Pam,Season 8,8x7
47630,Nope.,Jim,Season 8,8x7
47631,"I'm not asking if you're in to her. Just, objectively, do you find her attractive?",Pam,Season 8,8x7
47632,"And I'm telling you, I don't.",Jim,Season 8,8x7
47633,You don't find Cathy attractive?,Pam,Season 8,8x7
47634,"No, I don't.",Jim,Season 8,8x7
47635,"No, I'm not going to tell my nine-months-pregnant wife that I find her replacement objectively attractive. Just like I'm not going to tell my two-year-old daughter that violent video games are objectively more fun. It's true, but it doesn't help anybody.",Jim,Season 8,8x7
47636,Look at her. Even I want some fries with that shake.,Pam,Season 8,8x7
47637,"Okay. Uh, I don't. So are we good? [Jim leaves]",Jim,Season 8,8x7
47638,That's just absurd.,Dwight,Season 8,8x7
47639,"Yes, because she's hot, right?",Pam,Season 8,8x7
47640,"Her breasts are large, her waist is small, her reproductive health in ample evidence. And facial symmetry- come on.",Dwight,Season 8,8x7
47641,"The thing about pregnancy is people treat you differently. Like you're a kid almost. They lose all sense of boundaries. They start acting weird, telling you things that clearly aren't true. I know it sounds nuts, but I think Dwight is the only one who's telling me the truth.",Pam,Season 8,8x7
47642,"Dwight, am I hot right now?",Pam,Season 8,8x7
47643,"Why would I or anyone else think that you're hot right now? I can't impregnate you, and that's the driving force between male-female attraction.",Dwight,Season 8,8x7
47644,What about before? Was I attractive before?,Pam,Season 8,8x7
47645,"Meh... you were at your most attractive when you were 24 with a slight, gradual decline and a steep drop-off when you got pregnant for the first time. Gradual recovery and, uh, well now, obviously, you're at an all-time low.",Dwight,Season 8,8x7
47646,Hmm. I think Jim's lying to me about not being attracted to Cathy.,Pam,Season 8,8x7
47647,You think Jim's lying? [laughs] That's so cute. I know he's lying.,Dwight,Season 8,8x7
47648,Five bucks if you can get him to admit it.,Pam,Season 8,8x7
47649,Done. [Pam goes for a high five] I never touch a pregnant woman.,Dwight,Season 8,8x7
47650,"Yep, that's the Dwight I need.",Pam,Season 8,8x7
47651,"If we're going to work together, we need some ground rules.",Dwight,Season 8,8x7
47652,Okay.,Pam,Season 8,8x7
47653,Rule one: our only loyalty is to the truth.,Dwight,Season 8,8x7
47654,I think so. Okay.,Pam,Season 8,8x7
47655,Rule two: we stop at nothing.,Dwight,Season 8,8x7
47656,"Well, what does that... is that... okay.",Pam,Season 8,8x7
47657,Rule three: Don't fall in love.,Dwight,Season 8,8x7
47658,"Yep, good.",Pam,Season 8,8x7
47659,We're gonna bust this guy.,Dwight,Season 8,8x7
47660,Honesty is very important to me.,Pam,Season 8,8x7
47661,So important. And then we will destroy the man himself.,Dwight,Season 8,8x7
47662,Let's just see how we feel when we get there.,Pam,Season 8,8x7
47664,None taken. What do you got?,Dwight,Season 8,8x7
47666,Hmm.,Pam,Season 8,8x7
47685,"Hey, I was talking to Cathy. Turns out she is single.",Pam,Season 8,8x7
47686,"Oh, I stand corrected.",Jim,Season 8,8x7
47687,I thought it might be fun to set her up with someone. Any ideas?,Pam,Season 8,8x7
47688,"Oh, you know who might be good? Mike Tibbets.",Jim,Season 8,8x7
47689,"Mike Tibbets, really?",Pam,Season 8,8x7
47690,Mm-hmm.,Jim,Season 8,8x7
47692,Not his mom's car.,Jim,Season 8,8x7
47694,Touche?,Jim,Season 8,8x7
47696,"Kelly, calm down.",Pam,Season 8,8x7
47698,I don't think Jim cares about his hair.,Pam,Season 8,8x7
47700,I don't see what's so ugly about him. He's got the broad face of a brewer.,Dwight,Season 8,8x7
47701,Jim's on to me.,Pam,Season 8,8x7
47702,Hmm?,Dwight,Season 8,8x7
47703,"Yeah, Jim barely talks to Mike. We had to go through like two levels of friends to even find his profile. Jim picked someone just unattractive enough to shut me up without tipping it.",Pam,Season 8,8x7
47704,Just ugly enough to have deniability.,Dwight,Season 8,8x7
47705,Yep.,Pam,Season 8,8x7
47706,"Mike Tibbets is like the most boring-looking guy I know. So if that was for the matchmaker test, I think I'm in the clear. If that wasn't for the matchmaker test, then... Cathy, he's a really nice guy.",Jim,Season 8,8x7
47707,"Well, Jim may be lying with his words, but he can't lie with his body.",Dwight,Season 8,8x7
47709,"No, Kelly, don't.",Pam,Season 8,8x7
47710,"The male reveals attraction through unconscious and involuntary physical signs. The puffing of the chest, mirroring, increased blood flow to the crotch. I say we start there.",Dwight,Season 8,8x7
47712,With the crotch.,Dwight,Season 8,8x7
47714,Psst. We're not here. [slips Toblerone candy to Creed],Dwight,Season 8,8x7
47716,Exactly.,Dwight,Season 8,8x7
47718,"Okay, just shut it.",Dwight,Season 8,8x7
47719,Is he puffing out his chest?,Pam,Season 8,8x7
47720,I can't tell. It's unnaturally sunken. [Jim says something and Cathy laughs] Busted. He just was mirroring. Did you see that?,Dwight,Season 8,8x7
47721,No. Maybe he just said something funny.,Pam,Season 8,8x7
47722,"Jim has no discernible sense of humor, Pam. You should know that.",Dwight,Season 8,8x7
47723,I think he's just making her laugh.,Pam,Season 8,8x7
47724,Time for me to find out.,Dwight,Season 8,8x7
47725,Why's he making her laugh so much?,Pam,Season 8,8x7
47726,"Just going to walk over here- [fake trips] whoa, whoa, I'm slipping and falling! Oh, stumbling, I need something to grab on to! [grabs Jim's crotch]",Dwight,Season 8,8x7
47727,Dwight!,Jim,Season 8,8x7
47729,"I'm fine, I'm totally fine.",Dwight,Season 8,8x7
47730,Dwight! Dwight!,Jim,Season 8,8x7
47731,Yes? [Jim pushes Dwight's hands away] Wha- Jim.,Dwight,Season 8,8x7
47732,[to Cathy] Sorry about that.,Jim,Season 8,8x7
47733,"Aw, cramp, I'm just- [grabs Jim's crotch again]",Dwight,Season 8,8x7
47734,Dwight! [pushes Dwight's hands away] Why?,Jim,Season 8,8x7
47735,"I'm sorry, I fell down, Mr. Balance.",Dwight,Season 8,8x7
47736,Leave.,Jim,Season 8,8x7
47737,"[to Pam] Does your husband have very soft erections? Because if not, I just grabbed a very soft penis for nothing.",Dwight,Season 8,8x7
47738,Why was he making her laugh so much?,Pam,Season 8,8x7
47739,"Oh, hey, I'll just be a second.",Pam,Season 8,8x7
47741,Okay.,Pam,Season 8,8x7
47743,Mm-hmm?,Jim,Season 8,8x7
47745,[laughs] Told you.,Jim,Season 8,8x7
47747,"Oscar, Cathy has a question!",Pam,Season 8,8x7
47749,[to Jim] Yeah?,Pam,Season 8,8x7
47750,You okay?,Jim,Season 8,8x7
47751,Why won't you just admit that she's attractive? It's kind of annoying that you won't say it.,Pam,Season 8,8x7
47752,"Okay, what can I do to make you believe me?",Jim,Season 8,8x7
47753,"Well, Dwight had this idea, and I thought it was kind of crazy. But maybe that's where we are now.",Pam,Season 8,8x7
47754,"She called it crazy? Aw, man, that's insulting. All I did was propose a makeshift lie-detector test. Monitoring his blood pressure, pulse, perspiration, and breathing rate.",Dwight,Season 8,8x7
47755,"Yeah, its nuts. But I don't know what else to do.",Pam,Season 8,8x7
47756,And she called it nuts?,Dwight,Season 8,8x7
47767,Come on.,Dwight,Season 8,8x7
47768,Stop shoving me.,Jim,Season 8,8x7
47769,"[mocking] Stop shoving me. Stop grabbing my penis. Grow up. Take off your jacket and take a seat. When it lies, the human body exhibits many telltale signs.",Dwight,Season 8,8x7
47770,[to Pam] Really?,Jim,Season 8,8x7
47771,This could all go away if you just tell me the truth.,Pam,Season 8,8x7
47773,"Why don't you go check out the sympathy cards, old man? [to Jim] Now I'm going to ask you just a few simple questions. Wait for this to constrict. Here we go. Is your name Jim Halpert?",Dwight,Season 8,8x7
47774,Si.,Jim,Season 8,8x7
47775,"Wait, that's it? That's the question you're going to ask him?",Pam,Season 8,8x7
47776,We have to start with a baseline question to establish what the truth is.,Dwight,Season 8,8x7
47778,"[mimicking] Well, that's what they taught me in my 19th century kindergarten.",Dwight,Season 8,8x7
47779,"Okay, Dwight, come on. [to old man] You can go first.",Jim,Season 8,8x7
47781,"Jim, are you serious?",Dwight,Season 8,8x7
47782,"Oh, you know what? This reminds me, Cece needs a new toothbrush.",Jim,Season 8,8x7
47793,"[to old man] Okay, you're done.",Dwight,Season 8,8x7
47795,"Do you really, Tin Man? Okay, where were we?",Dwight,Season 8,8x7
47796,"No, I'm not worried. Because this lie isn't for me, it's for Pam. And when she gets her body back and her confidence back... yes, I will tell her the truth. That I had feelings for a co-worker today that I haven't had in years. But in my defense, he was grabbing my crotch fairly aggressively at the time.",Jim,Season 8,8x7
47797,Do you find Cathy Simms attractive?,Dwight,Season 8,8x7
47798,No.,Jim,Season 8,8x7
47799,"Yep, he's lying.",Dwight,Season 8,8x7
47800,"Ah, see, was that so hard?",Pam,Season 8,8x7
47801,I am not lying.,Jim,Season 8,8x7
47802,Really?,Pam,Season 8,8x7
47803,"Pam, are you really gonna listen to his stupid homemade test?",Jim,Season 8,8x7
47804,"I would listen to my homemade test, because your husband is definitely lying. In fact, he's lied about every question. Even his name. Who are you really?",Dwight,Season 8,8x7
47805,"Wait, what?",Pam,Season 8,8x7
47806,"Look at the numbers. Every single time, it's come up 150 over 100. Your husband is a pathological liar.",Dwight,Season 8,8x7
47807,"Jim, you have high blood pressure.",Pam,Season 8,8x7
47808,"Oh, he is definitely attracted to her.",Dwight,Season 8,8x7
47809,Doesn't your dad have high blood pressure?,Pam,Season 8,8x7
47810,"Yeah, but I don't smoke.",Jim,Season 8,8x7
47811,When was the last time you went to the doctor?,Pam,Season 8,8x7
47812,I don't know.,Jim,Season 8,8x7
47813,It's important to go every month and get your prostate checked. You can do it at home by yourself with your finger. You just stick it-,Dwight,Season 8,8x7
47814,"Dwight, stop. I'm not kidding, I mean, I need you to take care of yourself. What would we do if something happened to you?",Pam,Season 8,8x7
47815,"Okay, easy. Trust me, I'm around for the long-haul.",Jim,Season 8,8x7
47816,"It's not really your choice, is it? Death waits for no man.",Dwight,Season 8,8x7
47817,Okay.,Jim,Season 8,8x7
47818,"Come on, let's go. I wanna call your doctor.",Pam,Season 8,8x7
47819,Doesn't it worry you in the slightest that Jim is not his real name?,Dwight,Season 8,8x7
47820,Just go home. It doesn't matter.,Pam,Season 8,8x7
47821,"But... hey, Cece's toothbrush.",Dwight,Season 8,8x7
47822,Thank you.,Jim,Season 8,8x7
47833,[whispers to Jim] I'm gonna do it.,Pam,Season 8,8x8
47835,Oh! I'm going into labor! Oh my goodness!,Pam,Season 8,8x8
47836,"Oh okay, she's going into labor. Make way, everybody!",Jim,Season 8,8x8
47837,"I know it's wrong to fake going into labor just to get out of things, but sometimes it's necessary.",Pam,Season 8,8x8
47838,[after Angela gives her a stack of files]: I'm going into labor!,Pam,Season 8,8x8

47843,Here we go!,Pam,Season 8,8x8
47850,Okay.,Jim,Season 8,8x8
47851,Okay.,Pam,Season 8,8x8

47857,"Okay guys, here we go! We'll see you!",Jim,Season 8,8x8
47858,Oh!,Pam,Season 8,8x8
47859,How do you feel?,Jim,Season 8,8x8
47863,False alarm.,Pam,Season 8,8x8
47871,Gettysburg? Hmm. Could be interesting. Second-most northern battle in the Civil War.,Dwight,Season 8,8x8
47873,Ha!,Dwight,Season 8,8x8
47874,The Civil War history industry has conveniently forgotten about the battle of Schrute Farms. [scoffs] Whatever. I'm over it. It's just grossly irresponsible.,Dwight,Season 8,8x8
47884,Guess I'm a sucker for historical fiction.,Dwight,Season 8,8x8
47890,Cool. Thanks. [puts his hat on Erin's head],Jim,Season 8,8x8
47899,Here. Like it?,Pam,Season 8,8x8
47901,I can't get a fire pit. I have two babies.,Pam,Season 8,8x8
47904,"Plants and- hi, Robert! Hey, um, how are you doing? Good to see you again.",Pam,Season 8,8x8
47922,"Visitor center. Gonna grab a map for the memorials, right?",Jim,Season 8,8x8
47924,"No, of course we're not tourists. We're just people that aren't from here who are taking a tour.",Jim,Season 8,8x8
47929,"Total deaths belongs to Gettysburg but when you're talking about D.P.A., that's deaths per acre...",Dwight,Season 8,8x8
47931,...nothing beats the battle of Schrute Farms.,Dwight,Season 8,8x8
47933,"Oh, it is. And you should read some of these letters that the soldiers wrote home. I mean, it makes the battle of Gettysburg sound like a bunch of schoolgirls wrestling over a hairbrush. [laughs] I'm telling you, they're heartbreaking too. So beautifully written.",Dwight,Season 8,8x8
47935,The truth.,Dwight,Season 8,8x8
47938,"No, no, no! You're filling her head with nonsense. You and the history books. I'm telling the truth.",Dwight,Season 8,8x8
47940,"Yes, thank you. All of history has been whitewashed.",Dwight,Season 8,8x8
47942,"Okay, I will. I don't know who that is, but I'm gonna tell you this-",Dwight,Season 8,8x8
47944,"Gettysburg was very important. Credit where credit is due, okay? Big, mad props to Gettysburg. Was it, however, the most northern battle of the civil war?",Dwight,Season 8,8x8
47946,Not by a long shot!,Dwight,Season 8,8x8
47949,"No, it was not!",Dwight,Season 8,8x8
47951,"No, it was not. Was it the second-most northern?",Dwight,Season 8,8x8
47953,Sure! I will cede it was the second-most northernmost battle!,Dwight,Season 8,8x8
47955,"Was it the northernmost? No. Get out of here, Oscar.",Dwight,Season 8,8x8
47971,"Excuse me, I got a question for you.",Dwight,Season 8,8x8
47973,Can you tell us about the battle of Schrute Farms?,Dwight,Season 8,8x8
47975,"Really. Okay, follow-up question. How much are they paying you to keep your mouth shut?",Dwight,Season 8,8x8
47984,"Okay. You know the test booklets that they give out in all the schools. I was thinking that we could put a coupon in the back that people would mail in to us... and as, you know, as I tell it, I don't like it. Unless, of course, you are responding to it.",Pam,Season 8,8x8
47986,"Um, excuse me. I'm gonna go to the bathroom.",Pam,Season 8,8x8
47987,"At this point, when you're this pregnant, it's kind of like senior spring. The other day I spit my gum out on the carpet.",Pam,Season 8,8x8

48003,"Yeah, that's what I had for breakfast and I think that's probably why I'm still hungry.",Jim,Season 8,8x8
48009,Only two hundred dollars?,Jim,Season 8,8x8
48014,Oh wow.  So that's two miles if you incorporate the walk back.,Jim,Season 8,8x8
48018,[Andy looks back to find everyone sitting] You said you weren't going to look back.,Dwight,Season 8,8x8
48024,Really?,Dwight,Season 8,8x8
48026,Well.  Anyone employed by the Gettysburg Industrial Complex is certainly going to want to keep quiet about the Battle of Schrute Farms.,Dwight,Season 8,8x8
48029,YES!  Ha!  Prepare to be refuted!  Go on.,Dwight,Season 8,8x8
48033,Hallowed ground.,Dwight,Season 8,8x8
48037,I've seen enough.,Dwight,Season 8,8x8
48055,Yeah sorry everyone else didn't come.  I think they're just tired.  With holes in their shoes.  And they have dysentery.,Jim,Season 8,8x8
48057,What are you talking about?,Jim,Season 8,8x8
48059,Andy ' this whole idea of our situation being just like war?  It's just not true.  We just work at a paper company.  And you're our regional manager.  And guess what man?  You don't have to prove anything.  We like you as regional manager.  Andy if you don't believe me take a look at what's on my head.  I'm wearing a very pink hat.  I've been getting weird looks all day because I'm pretty sure 'DM does GB' means something kinda sexual.  But guess who's wearing them?  All of us.  Just for you man.  That's huge.,Jim,Season 8,8x8

48089,"Best thing you can do for the deceased is to pee on their graves. Then you dance and work the urine into the root systems. Doesn't hurt to have a smile on your face, either.",Dwight,Season 8,8x8
48092,It's locked.,Jim,Season 8,8x8
48094,"It's not locked, gimme that...",Dwight,Season 8,8x8
48095,"That's weird, if it's not locked, why isn't it opening?",Jim,Season 8,8x8
48096,"It's, it's latched closed.",Dwight,Season 8,8x8

48132,Because you're sitting?,Jim,Season 8,8x9
48133,Standing.,Dwight,Season 8,8x9
48134,Ok.,Jim,Season 8,8x9
48135,Don't!,Dwight,Season 8,8x9
48136,Because you're sitting?,Jim,Season 8,8x9
48137,Standing.,Dwight,Season 8,8x9
48138,You know I have to do this.,Jim,Season 8,8x9
48139,"I know. [Jim pushes him over, Dwight screams]",Dwight,Season 8,8x9
48141,I think you could just do Andy Bernard.,Jim,Season 8,8x9
48145,I don't know. He wasn't talking to me. But if I were you I wouldn't hire his wife.,Jim,Season 8,8x9
48156,"Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock.",Dwight,Season 8,8x9
48158,[laughs] Remember how you said that you were looking in the office to do calisthenics and aerobics?,Dwight,Season 8,8x9
48160,Well today's your lucky day. I have opened in this very office building Dwight Schrute's Gym for Muscles. You wanna take a look?,Dwight,Season 8,8x9
48162,Your path from obesity begins right here!,Dwight,Season 8,8x9
48164,"Obese people in my office are a drain on resources. Chairs wear out faster, it takes more Freon to keep them cool, they flush the toilets more often, plus their massive BMs bust the rivets on my pipes. But a gym turns fat into cash.",Dwight,Season 8,8x9
48180,Well it's sales. So you have to be able to live in the world of rejection.,Jim,Season 8,8x9
48181,Maybe you do. Hi. I'm Dwight. Sales is really not so hard ok? It's paper. We have it and they want it so bad they are willing to pay for it.,Dwight,Season 8,8x9
48183,Well it's not that easy. It's kind of sometimes difficult.,Jim,Season 8,8x9
48184,It's the second easiest job in the world. [to camera] Being a mom.,Dwight,Season 8,8x9
48186,That is true.,Dwight,Season 8,8x9
48188,That's me.,Dwight,Season 8,8x9
48190,Maybe over a beer after she's closed her first sale [makes gun click noise].,Dwight,Season 8,8x9
48193,Ready? What do you think?,Dwight,Season 8,8x9
48195,"You haven't even looked around yet. Look. Gravel bucket squat yoke [squats, grunts and lifts] Right? Dedicated phone book ripping station [tries and fails to tear a phone book in half]. You ever cut tin before? Five yards in and your forearms will be on fire. Plus I will buy the tin back from you that you cut for two cents a yard. Now let's go over membership. I'm going to need the first month's and the last month's up front. $49 per month. But every third month is $59 a month. But the fourth month is a discount month at $19 per month'",Dwight,Season 8,8x9
48197,Darryl... [picks up sledgehammer and swings it at a hanging tire],Dwight,Season 8,8x9
48221,Attention! I am now accepting memberships for Dwight Schrute's Gym for Muscles. The first 20 members can take advantage of the pay what you weigh promotion.,Dwight,Season 8,8x9
48226,Kelly?,Dwight,Season 8,8x9
48228,That's okay. I know how to build a business. You gotta get the black people to do it to get the white people to do it. Then you gotta get the black people to stop doing it. One step at a time.,Dwight,Season 8,8x9
48247,"No, I don't think we should be trying to make this place seem unpleasant. I think we should let this place just crush her spirit by itself. I mean, it knows what it's doing.",Jim,Season 8,8x9
48249,"Oh, wow. So cute.",Jim,Season 8,8x9
48259,Very cute. [holds out the phone],Jim,Season 8,8x9

48283,"I build you this temple to the human body, and you're lifting what, five pounds?",Dwight,Season 8,8x9
48285,I was watching you. You want to know how long it really was?,Dwight,Season 8,8x9
48287,Eight minutes!,Dwight,Season 8,8x9
48289,Is that the same philosophy you apply to buffalo wings? [points] I want you to bring that same buffalo wing passion to this gym! I'm gonna make you look like Lebron James!,Dwight,Season 8,8x9
48291,That's what I said.,Dwight,Season 8,8x9
48293,I know.,Dwight,Season 8,8x9

48333,"First thing, we're gonna stretch the pelvic bowl. Ready? Get down on the floor.",Dwight,Season 8,8x9
48335,Really? Too embarrassing for you? Huh? You wish that every exercise was strutting around the gym like the Fonz? Well how do you think the Fonz got so cool? He stretched his pelvic bowl!,Dwight,Season 8,8x9
48342,Do I?,Jim,Season 8,8x9
48344,"[mutters] I know, I do.",Jim,Season 8,8x9
48346,I really wish I could help. I'm not really sure how I can...,Jim,Season 8,8x9
48348,"That's the thing. See, I didn't want to get in the middle of this. Still don't. But here's something: I feel that maybe, if we take a step back, this is a simple case of anxiety to work with a spouse.",Jim,Season 8,8x9
48352,Perfect!,Jim,Season 8,8x9
48354,Yes?,Jim,Season 8,8x9
48356,"[sighs] I don't know what you want me to tell you. To be really honest, my wife works here. And I love it. She literally makes me work harder. She makes me smarter. She makes me remember why I'm here. And between us, she's on maternity leave right now, and I would love to leave this room and see her face. I would love it. I don't know how this helps, but it's just what I'm thinking.",Jim,Season 8,8x9
48358,Yes. All right. Great. [leaves],Jim,Season 8,8x9
48378,"You're nothing! You're so weak, you call yourself a man? Huh?",Dwight,Season 8,8x9
48380,"Okay, fine. Finish your set on your own and never come back to my gym again!",Dwight,Season 8,8x9
48382,"All right, I'll help you. But first, you gotta tell me what your goal is. What do you want?",Dwight,Season 8,8x9
48384,"No! Because if that was the case, the bar would be up by now. What is your goal?",Dwight,Season 8,8x9
48386,What do you want!?!,Dwight,Season 8,8x9
48388,Val Kilmer? I don't buy it. That doesn't make any sense. Wow... I figured out your goal. I am going to make you the buffest dude Val Kilmer has ever seen.,Dwight,Season 8,8x9
48391,"Hey, what are you listening to?",Dwight,Season 8,8x9
48394,There is no shower.,Dwight,Season 8,8x9
48396,"What does this look like, a shower store? Get lost.",Dwight,Season 8,8x9
48398,"Exercise lengthens life. Improves mood, boosts sex drive, and I've already covered the BM of it all. It's miraculous the effect that I will have on their lives.",Dwight,Season 8,8x9
48401,This whole thing is making me very uncomfortable. I'm not getting between the boss and his wife so just ask me about something else. You know Stanley's tie is really the story of the day...,Jim,Season 8,8x9
48403,"Ok, so that's a disaster. Luckily have a two-part plan. One, run. Two, hide. It's pretty smart, right? [walks into Vance Refrigeration office] Hi, how you doing? I'm Jim Halpert from across the hall. We are redoing our supply closet and I was wondering if I could take a look at yours for some ideas.",Jim,Season 8,8x9
48405,"You absolutely should. He said it was ok, so till you get him, I'll just be in, you know. [closes door behind him to supply closet]",Jim,Season 8,8x9
48417,I got Stanley tickets to see Lewis Black for his birthday. ...Might not have been the best idea.,Jim,Season 8,8x10

48431,Yeah.,Jim,Season 8,8x10
48455,Fine with me. Jim can leave anytime he wants. Goodbye.,Dwight,Season 8,8x10
48456,It wasn't me.,Jim,Season 8,8x10
48458,Kathy wants to leave our clump?,Jim,Season 8,8x10
48460,"I just wanna say, this is not my fault. OK? The weak always bully the strong. Contrary to what you see in the media. I am always acting in self-defense. Occasionally preemptive self-defense. [punches Jim in the arm]",Dwight,Season 8,8x10
48461,"Ow, What are you doing? [Jim fights back]",Jim,Season 8,8x10
48463,Pam never seemed to have a problem with us.,Jim,Season 8,8x10
48465,What was that?,Jim,Season 8,8x10
48466,What is it?,Dwight,Season 8,8x10
48468,Can't do that.,Jim,Season 8,8x10
48469,"No, absolutely not.",Dwight,Season 8,8x10

48527,"[on phone] Uh, yeah. I just got my replacement credit card...you want the number? Oh it's uh four seven nine three, zero zero three two, three three one three. The security code is nine two seven. OK great. Thank you very much. Bye.",Jim,Season 8,8x10
48528,"So Dwight did take the bait. He used my credit card numbers to send a two hundred dollar bouquet of flowers, to my wife...from me.",Jim,Season 8,8x10
48529,[laughing] Boom!,Dwight,Season 8,8x10
48548,Ah! I've been attacked! Oh my god! Oh! Someone put a porcupine in my drawer!,Dwight,Season 8,8x10

48551,"I wonder, in this office, who has access to a porcupine?",Jim,Season 8,8x10
48552,Or who in this office knows that I have access and is trying to set me up?,Dwight,Season 8,8x10
48553,Hmm...,Jim,Season 8,8x10
48558,Hello? Lacerated hand here folks.,Dwight,Season 8,8x10
48559,"Nice try, this is ridiculous.",Jim,Season 8,8x10
48560,Oh is it really? Two separate times you have set me up to believe I was being recruited by the CIA.,Dwight,Season 8,8x10
48561,Three times.,Jim,Season 8,8x10

49160,I'm not going to help you. Why would you choose me? Because I'm mighty? Because I'm the manliest man in the office? I'll do it. [he picks her up],Dwight,Season 8,8x12
49163,You stop.,Dwight,Season 8,8x12
49165,"No, you stop.",Dwight,Season 8,8x12
49167,"Okay, you can stop.",Dwight,Season 8,8x12
49169,"No, you can stop.",Dwight,Season 8,8x12
49175,Good night.,Jim,Season 8,8x12
49189,"[he and Erin feed each other chips] Ah, mmm. So good. Now take a chip, crush it into my face, really rub the grease around. Do it. Now rub it in. Oh, yeah, that's so good. Ah...",Dwight,Season 8,8x12
49191,Damn it.,Dwight,Season 8,8x12
49193,We can get some chicken fights going in the pool.,Dwight,Season 8,8x12
49198,Chicken fight!,Dwight,Season 8,8x12
49201,"Hey, Cathy. Chicken fight!",Dwight,Season 8,8x12
49204,Yeah- oh!,Dwight,Season 8,8x12
49206,Woohoo! Yes!,Dwight,Season 8,8x12
49208,I know. I could just bang you right now.,Dwight,Season 8,8x12
49211,To both these bears.,Jim,Season 8,8x12
49237,[to Erin] Maybe we should take a little break.,Dwight,Season 8,8x12
49239,Okay.,Dwight,Season 8,8x12
49244,Go!,Dwight,Season 8,8x12
49253,"[coughs up water] Erin, did we win?",Dwight,Season 8,8x12
49255,You're lying. We didn't win.,Dwight,Season 8,8x12
49260,"Ugh. Same old party, same old people. Am I right? Reminds me of Phyllis's birthday.",Dwight,Season 8,8x12
49262,"I know. [laughs] But boy, that Erin. She sure is a ripe little tiger, isn't she? Rroww! And to think, I always thought of her as a second Meredith. Respectfully, I don't want us walking into a similar Angela kind of situation.",Dwight,Season 8,8x12
49264,"So I just want to make sure that you are completely, one hundred percent done with Erin.",Dwight,Season 8,8x12
49266,Not what I asked.,Dwight,Season 8,8x12
49268,"So then you won't mind if tonight I just go crazy on her, just go nuts, rrargh. With sex.",Dwight,Season 8,8x12
49270,[sighs] You're an idiot.,Dwight,Season 8,8x12
49287,To madness.,Jim,Season 8,8x12
49291,"Hey, um, I think you parked my car in. Is there any way you can move your van?",Jim,Season 8,8x12
49293,Are you serious?,Jim,Season 8,8x12
49300,And there's my talking point.,Jim,Season 8,8x12
49310,Uh huh.,Dwight,Season 8,8x12
49312,Yeah....baby.,Dwight,Season 8,8x12
49317,"Hey, have you ever been checked for scoliosis?",Dwight,Season 8,8x12
49319,"No, seriously. Your spine is jacked. It's like the devil's cursive.",Dwight,Season 8,8x12
49321,You'd be like 8 feet tall if this thing was straightened out...[pushes Erin back to floor],Dwight,Season 8,8x12
49324,"[Erin helps Dwight stretch his inner thighs] Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oooooh, yeah.",Dwight,Season 8,8x12
49327,Yeah...,Dwight,Season 8,8x12
49329,Ready?,Dwight,Season 8,8x12
49334,RAHHH!!!!!!!,Dwight,Season 8,8x12
49336,Get her! Ruin her! [Andy and Jessica beat Dwight and Erin],Dwight,Season 8,8x12
49343,To the shame room! [raises bottle],Jim,Season 8,8x12
49357,Hey.,Jim,Season 8,8x13
49359,Okay.,Jim,Season 8,8x13
49361,Yeah.,Jim,Season 8,8x13
49363,"It was pretty uneventful, actually.",Jim,Season 8,8x13
49364,Can't believe they let someone like you serve on a jury. Makes me question the whole judicial system.,Dwight,Season 8,8x13
49366,"Uh, hit and run.",Jim,Season 8,8x13
49369,Nope. Not guilty.,Jim,Season 8,8x13
49370,"Of course you found him not guilty. [mocking voice] 'Oh, he apologized and I just really want him to like me, mm.'",Dwight,Season 8,8x13
49371,"We're best friends, actually. We're going wine-tasting next weekend, if you want to come.",Jim,Season 8,8x13
49372,"Not coming, have plans.",Dwight,Season 8,8x13
49373,Okay.,Jim,Season 8,8x13
49374,"I did get called in to jury duty. And they released me around noon, so, didn't think it was worth it to come back to work for a half day. And then the next morning Pam was a little overwhelmed with the kids so I took an extra day to help out. And then three other days happened.",Jim,Season 8,8x13
49387,"Aw man, I would but I can't miss any more work.",Jim,Season 8,8x13
49395,"Mine was actually a pretty boring case, so-",Jim,Season 8,8x13
49399,"Wow, I'm really sorry.",Jim,Season 8,8x13
49401,I never considered that my week off would make everyone else's job harder. The least I could do is give them a good story.,Jim,Season 8,8x13
49402,"[demonstrating with napkin holder and salt shaker] So Phyllis, he was here, and then the car came and did- he was like that. Yeah, so it had to be a double backflip, actually.",Jim,Season 8,8x13
49404,"Oh man, Ernesto's. That was our favorite restaurant too.",Jim,Season 8,8x13
49407,"I was in Los Angeles last year. Jim tricked me into thinking I'd won a walk-on part on NCIS, but that's not important. While I was being kicked off the lot, I saw food trucks everywhere. Everyone in Los Angeles eats from them. And nobody calls them restaurants.",Dwight,Season 8,8x13
49423,"So this whole hit and run thing, there's just one part I can't figure out. You said it was at a four-way stop...",Dwight,Season 8,8x13
49424,Mm-hmm.,Jim,Season 8,8x13
49425,And the victim rode his bicycle into the left hand turn lane but the perp was already in the left-hand turn lane?,Dwight,Season 8,8x13
49426,Mm-hmm.,Jim,Season 8,8x13
49427,"See, that's what I'm having trouble with, because the fact is, you never said he was on a bicycle. [villainous laugh] Busted, Halpert!",Dwight,Season 8,8x13
49428,"Okay, wait, wait.",Jim,Season 8,8x13
49429,"Yes! Andy, get out here.",Dwight,Season 8,8x13
49430,No. I never said he was on a bicycle. I just said I wasn't listening to you.,Jim,Season 8,8x13
49431,I am making a citizen's arrest. You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to beg for mercy. You have the right to request judgment by combat. Dwight's rights.,Dwight,Season 8,8x13
49433,Jim was lying about jury duty. He was lying the whole time so he could go do yoga or go canoeing. I don't know what this pervert likes. Fire him!,Dwight,Season 8,8x13
49435,I have Jim on the record saying that the vic-,Dwight,Season 8,8x13
49437,I don't- I don't need to take a chill pill.,Dwight,Season 8,8x13
49439,I really don't want to take the chill pill. [mimes taking pill],Dwight,Season 8,8x13
49441,"Okay, okay. [sits, exhales] But let's just say that Jim was lying about jury duty. You would have to fire him, right?",Dwight,Season 8,8x13
49443,That's good enough for me. [exhales again],Dwight,Season 8,8x13
49444,"...and Pam was just going crazy, trying to take care of Philip because Cece has been out of control recently, and- look, Andy, it doesn't matter. The truth is, I just feel terrible lying to you.",Jim,Season 8,8x13
49446,Okay. I think the best thing to do right now is just come clean and tell everybody the truth.,Jim,Season 8,8x13
49448,No.,Jim,Season 8,8x13
49450,No.,Jim,Season 8,8x13
49452,Are you sure you can keep this under wraps?,Jim,Season 8,8x13
49456,"Okay, everybody, gather 'round. Got a real special surprise for you. [indicates Ernesto and assistant who are carrying empanadas]",Dwight,Season 8,8x13
49462,"Okay- oh, Jim. Hey, this guy look familiar?",Dwight,Season 8,8x13
49463,Uh-,Jim,Season 8,8x13
49465,The empanada guy!,Jim,Season 8,8x13
49466,"No, Toby! [bleep] Damn it, Toby! No, I wasn't asking you. [sighs] Ask him if he remembers Jim. [Nate asks Ernesto a question in Spanish]",Dwight,Season 8,8x13
49469,"He says, 'No!' Boom!",Dwight,Season 8,8x13
49471,"Okay, he remembers Toby, the most forgettable man in the known world. [Ernesto says something in Spanish]",Dwight,Season 8,8x13
49473,"Uh, you guys are going to love these. So, empanadas on me. You guys gotta try them.",Jim,Season 8,8x13
49475,"Great. And while we're enjoying these delicious empanadas, Jim, why don't you tell us your story again?",Dwight,Season 8,8x13
49477,Walk us through it. What time would you get there every morning?,Dwight,Season 8,8x13
49481,Because my car broke down.,Jim,Season 8,8x13
49483,"Wait, wait. You live by the courthouse. So you drove from near the courthouse, out to Jim's house, and then back to the courthouse?",Dwight,Season 8,8x13
49487,"Well, I think you handled it pretty well.",Jim,Season 8,8x13
49489,"Okay, listen, all right? Dwight's on to us, he's going to figure it out really soon, so let's just get ahead of it, let's tell the truth.",Jim,Season 8,8x13
49506,"Uh, excuse me, can I have everyone's attention for a second? First off, I just want to say that I'm really sorry, I didn't know that my absence last week would have been a burden on any of you, because, though I did have jury duty last week, they did dismiss me early on Monday. And I think you're going to find this pretty hilarious. I kind of, uh, well, maybe took the week off.",Jim,Season 8,8x13
49508,Funny? No? Nobody laughing?,Jim,Season 8,8x13
49509,"[laughs] You're screwed! Oh, it's happening. It's really happening.",Dwight,Season 8,8x13
49511,"Pam really needed some help with the kids, so, I promise my intentions were good.",Jim,Season 8,8x13
49512,Your clients. They're all mine.,Dwight,Season 8,8x13
49515,"All right, well. Let's get this show on the road, shall we? Allow me to give you a hand. [puts Jim's things in a box] Here we are. So long, clump-mate. I'm going to miss you. Truth be told, I never thought that this was how it was going to end. I always thought that I was going to defeat you somehow. But you've defeated yourself. [laughs]",Dwight,Season 8,8x13
49517,"No, no, no. You said- you said that you were-",Dwight,Season 8,8x13
49519,That's it? This is crap! [dumps the box on Jim's desk and leaves],Dwight,Season 8,8x13
49521,"Gabe, it's Dwight again. Highest priority, triple-urgent. Call me. Immediately. That means ASAP.",Dwight,Season 8,8x13
49522,"I'm gonna find Gabe, tell him what Jim did and let the little stickler do what he does best: stickle.",Dwight,Season 8,8x13
49539,"Oh, hey. Have you seen Gabe?",Dwight,Season 8,8x13
49541,Okay. [sits],Dwight,Season 8,8x13
49543,Psh! Why? I know what Angela and the senator look like. I can mash that up in my head right now.,Dwight,Season 8,8x13
49545,So don't.,Dwight,Season 8,8x13
49547,What?,Dwight,Season 8,8x13
49549,How long before?,Dwight,Season 8,8x13
49551,Yes I did.,Dwight,Season 8,8x13
49554,I want to see the baby.,Dwight,Season 8,8x13
49556,"Oh, yes. Oh, what a beautiful child. Prominent forehead, short arms, tiny nose. You will lead millions... [whispers] willingly, or as slaves.",Dwight,Season 8,8x13
49557,"That baby is a Schrute. And unless somebody taught Mose sex, that baby is mine.",Dwight,Season 8,8x13
49563,[to Cece] You want a giraffe?,Jim,Season 8,8x13
49564,"Yes, I am brining my kids in to help me get out of this hole. And you all remember my beautiful wife, Pam.",Jim,Season 8,8x13
49565,"Hi. Wow, I really thought I'd be more excited to be here.",Pam,Season 8,8x13
49566,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, game face, baby, game face.",Jim,Season 8,8x13
49567,"Oh right, okay. Hey Stanley, it's great to see you!",Pam,Season 8,8x13
49568,"Whoa, no, no. That's overdoing it, I think.",Jim,Season 8,8x13
49569,"Oh, hi Stanley.",Pam,Season 8,8x13
49570,Split the difference?,Jim,Season 8,8x13
49571,Jim.,Pam,Season 8,8x13
49572,"Okay, let's go.",Jim,Season 8,8x13
49573,Hey.,Pam,Season 8,8x13
49575,Hi everybody!,Pam,Season 8,8x13
49576,What?,Jim,Season 8,8x13
49578,How about a little visit?,Pam,Season 8,8x13
49579,"Wow, what a surprise. That's crazy. You guys get to meet the little heck-raisers.",Jim,Season 8,8x13
49581,"Yes, well, you guys all know Cece, but we wanted to introduce you to baby Philip.",Pam,Season 8,8x13
49584,"No, it's the pacifier's turn.",Pam,Season 8,8x13
49586,Did you say something about this one bringing in something for these people?,Jim,Season 8,8x13
49587,"[gasps] Yes! Cece wanted to thank everybody for letting her daddy stay home with her all last week and play, so she brought you a little treat.",Pam,Season 8,8x13
49589,"No, but that would've been a really good idea.",Pam,Season 8,8x13
49590,That was a great idea.,Jim,Season 8,8x13
49591,"No, she brought you drawings.",Pam,Season 8,8x13
49592,"Oh my goodness, let's take a look at these. They're usually amazing, so let's see. Yup, they are. Uncle Andy.",Jim,Season 8,8x13
49594,"Oh, Aunt Phyllis.",Jim,Season 8,8x13
49598,"She says 'no' to everything. You know, she thinks my name is 'No.' Cece, do you want some broccoli?",Pam,Season 8,8x13
49600,No. It's crazy.,Pam,Season 8,8x13
49607,"You know what? I don't think you need to do things on command. That's very weird. I'll just take that. Thank you. I think we should just wrap up the show, kiddos. Right?",Jim,Season 8,8x13
49609,Shh.,Pam,Season 8,8x13
49610,I don't know what else we can do here.,Jim,Season 8,8x13
49612,It's okay.,Jim,Season 8,8x13
49613,"Oh, it's okay, sweetie.",Pam,Season 8,8x13
49614,"All right, all right. Okay.",Jim,Season 8,8x13

49619,"Angela, this child is definitely mine. He looks just like me.",Dwight,Season 8,8x13
49621,Need I remind you that we were together a month before the wedding?,Dwight,Season 8,8x13
49623,Completely true. Remember? Angela. No.,Dwight,Season 8,8x13
49624,You said that Robert was not fulfilling you-,Dwight,Season 8,8x13
49626,"-and I said, 'I bet I could fulfill you,' and you said, 'I'd like to see you try,' and then I kissed you with the force of a thousand waterfalls.",Dwight,Season 8,8x13
49628,And then I inserted my penis-,Dwight,Season 8,8x13
49630,Into your-,Dwight,Season 8,8x13

49672,"Oh, right. [sighs] The office looks different now. Huh. Smaller. Maybe I just feel bigger. Hello Gabe.",Dwight,Season 8,8x13
49674,"Oh, you know, I did but now it seems infinitely insignificant.",Dwight,Season 8,8x13
49675,"Jim? Oh, right. Nah, forget it. He was doing it for his kids. I get it. Kids drive us dads crazy. Sometimes I feel like they're raising us. Am I right?",Dwight,Season 8,8x13
49676,"I would love for everyone to just forgive me. But, if that's not happening, I'm not averse to just buying them all off.",Jim,Season 8,8x13
49677,"Alright guys. You know how we all like the red licorice but it's always buried behind like a ton of black licorice? [points to pile of candy] Bought it all. Now it's like red city in there. So, enjoy it.",Jim,Season 8,8x13

50978,Robert doesn't talk like that. You have to stop Dwight from doing this.,Pam,Season 8,8x18
50979,I tried. He will not listen.,Jim,Season 8,8x18
50980,Did you actually try your hardest?,Pam,Season 8,8x18

53887,At first I drove myself crazy thinking about the things I should have done differently. I never should have played that joke on Erin.

54144,"Yeah, yeah, no, no. It's a good idea to brush your teeth. But you have to um, feed your children. Send them to school. You know, all things you can't do if you just keep singing 'Monster Mash.'",Pam,Season 9,9x5
54160,[whispering] I want some of those pills.,Dwight,Season 9,9x5

56206,"Last week, my company in Philly lost a big investor, so we're scrambling to find new funding. Luckily, my partners have a fix ' me asking the boss of the company I'm abandoning to give us a gigantic influx of cash.  So' problem solved. Thanks, guys.",Jim,Season 9,9x13

56213,I'm sure he's just nervous.,Jim,Season 9,9x13
56214,[sighs] It's fine. It's just a seating arrangement. Doesn't matter.,Pam,Season 9,9x13
56215,"So I've got your resume here, but it's not telling me everything.",Dwight,Season 9,9x13
56217,"Well, I'm the one offering the job.",Dwight,Season 9,9x13
56219,I've worked here for 12 years. I won salesman of the year. I'm an Assistant to the Regional Manager.,Dwight,Season 9,9x13
56221,"Wait, wait, wait, no, I mean, if you need to know more, you can call David Wallace. I'm sure he'd give a reference.",Dwight,Season 9,9x13
56223,"Well, they can't all be winners. But Trevor's next and he's a real professional. You say, 'Jump,' and he says, 'Oh who?' He loves to jump on people, that Trevor.",Dwight,Season 9,9x13
56224,What makes you think you'd be an effective paper salesman?,Dwight,Season 9,9x13
56226,"Well, it's a pretty basic question for a potential paper salesman.",Dwight,Season 9,9x13
56228,All right. Do you see yourself as more of a team player or a self-starter?,Dwight,Season 9,9x13
56230,There were only two options.,Dwight,Season 9,9x13
56232,This is a bus transfer.,Dwight,Season 9,9x13
56235,"Sure, yeah, go ahead.",Jim,Season 9,9x13
56237,"Yeah, absolutely.  Do people like sitting next to you? You're clean, right?",Jim,Season 9,9x13
56239,"Nice. Music. Do you listen to it in earbuds? You don't listen to it at all because we're at work, not a Florence and the Machine concert, so'",Jim,Season 9,9x13
56241,"Sure, yeah. Do whatever you need to do.",Jim,Season 9,9x13
56243,Right after you do one thing for me. I need you to breathe in my face.,Jim,Season 9,9x13

56249,"I knew it, I knew it.",Jim,Season 9,9x13
56251,"I looked at you coming around, and I said, 'Wintergreen.'",Jim,Season 9,9x13
56252,"I can't hire Clark. Yeah, he looks like a Schrute, but he thinks like a Halpert and he acts like a Beesly.",Dwight,Season 9,9x13
56253,"Okay, here's one. A customer who ordered enough paper to qualify for a volume discount now wants to return half the stock.  You can't rebate the sales price or credit for future purchases because you brokered the deal for a third party.",Dwight,Season 9,9x13
56255,Thank you.,Dwight,Season 9,9x13
56257,"Damn it! Perfect answer, again.",Dwight,Season 9,9x13

56270,"Well, of course not, but does physical appearance include smell?",Pam,Season 9,9x13
56275,"Next up, my cousin Mose. Mose could make a great paper salesman. He's got a natural fear of paper, which would motivate him to get as much of it out of this office as possible. I've got big expectations, Mose-wise.",Dwight,Season 9,9x13
56276,What quality would make you a good sales associate?,Dwight,Season 9,9x13
56278,It says here on your resume that you spent the last 15 years as a sales rep for Dow Chemical.,Dwight,Season 9,9x13
56280,"You know we live together, right?",Dwight,Season 9,9x13
56282,"And I've never seen you go to work, ever.",Dwight,Season 9,9x13
56284,So why is this on your resume? [door slams],Dwight,Season 9,9x13
56296,"When I was young, I spent several years at a private school where I was told I would be taught to harness my mutant abilities. Turned out it was a conman copying Charles Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters from the X-Men comic books. Took me years to figure out that it was a con. Some people never figured it out.",Dwight,Season 9,9x13
56301,How is it my fault?,Jim,Season 9,9x13
56303,But it's Dwight who's bring in all the weirdos.,Jim,Season 9,9x13
56305,"Hey, I'm the one who has to sit next to this weirdo when Jim's away. I'm in a position where I'm rooting for Nate, and that just feels wrong. [sighs] Forget it.  I need to work on my mural. I have some pointy trees that I need to round off.",Pam,Season 9,9x13
56307,"Yeah, this is actually about the new sales guy. Uh, Dwight has brought in a bunch of real weirdos. And I was wondering if I could have some input'",Jim,Season 9,9x13
56308,[presses speaker button] This is Dwight Schrute. Who am I speaking to? And don't lie. I can tell if you're lying.,Dwight,Season 9,9x13
56310,David.,Dwight,Season 9,9x13
56312,"Really? That's interesting. 'Cause I was thinking that since Jim is only here part time, he might not be as invested in the decision-making process as someone like me who's here every day. And frankly, killing it lately.",Dwight,Season 9,9x13
56313,"I was just thinking that because this person is gonna be sitting at my desk, near my wife'",Jim,Season 9,9x13
56315,Oh. Um',Jim,Season 9,9x13
56317,Okay. I can't say that that's not fair.,Jim,Season 9,9x13
56318,"Sounds fair to me, David.",Dwight,Season 9,9x13
56320,"Oh, yeah, so we'll just do that later.",Jim,Season 9,9x13
56321,No. Why not do it now?,Dwight,Season 9,9x13
56323,"Uh' [clears throat] Well, it's about Athlead. I'm sorry. Does Dwight have to be on this part of the phone call?",Jim,Season 9,9x13

56329,[whispers] I'd love to invest.,Dwight,Season 9,9x13
56330,"No, thanks.",Jim,Season 9,9x13
56331,I'd like to give you $100 million. [snickers] [phone ringing],Dwight,Season 9,9x13
56333,"Hide, they're giving out jobs upstairs. Why don't you go up and get one?",Pam,Season 9,9x13
56335,Yeah.,Pam,Season 9,9x13
56338,"Dwight, you can't just hire someone 'cause they're your friend.",Jim,Season 9,9x13
56339,I'm not. These people are the best of the best. I find talent an attractive quality in a friend.,Dwight,Season 9,9x13

56345,"Wolf is hilarious. He has executed me over 100 times at point-blank range. Half of 'em, we were on the same team. Oh my God. How I screamed. Ah, that goof.",Dwight,Season 9,9x13
56346,Sell me this piece of paper. Watch this.,Dwight,Season 9,9x13

56358,This isn't gonna work out.,Dwight,Season 9,9x13
56360,"Nate is a proven entity, but not without his handicaps; hearing, vision, basic cognition. Trevor is great, but I saw no fire in him today. And this is a guy who loves to start fires. Troy is literally one of a kind. He's a goblin, or a hobbit, or a kobold, which is a type of gremlin. And yet I'm hesitant. Why can't I pull the trigger on any of them?",Dwight,Season 9,9x13
56361,"[groaning] No, no, no. I just need to tell them. I just need to tell them. [knock at door]",Dwight,Season 9,9x13
56363,I do that myself now.,Dwight,Season 9,9x13

56376,Just act natural. [grunts],Dwight,Season 9,9x13
56377,And I was thinking it's only fair that you help make this decision since they'll be sitting at your desk next to your wife.,Dwight,Season 9,9x13
56378,But you know I wouldn't hire any of these all-stars.,Jim,Season 9,9x13
56379,"Aah! God, that sucks! Aah! What are you gonna do? I mean, it's your call.",Dwight,Season 9,9x13
56380,Nope. Your friends not turning out to be as great as you thought? Not even Gabor?,Jim,Season 9,9x13
56381,I guess I just have higher standards for my work colleagues than for my friends. I just couldn't picture any of them in the old gold and gray.,Dwight,Season 9,9x13

56388,What? This is such bullcrap!,Dwight,Season 9,9x13
56389,"Well, you know, Wallace put me in charge, so you have no say.",Jim,Season 9,9x13
56390,Wow. So much crap. It's just a load of B.C. How could you do this to them?,Dwight,Season 9,9x13
56391,Too much now.,Jim,Season 9,9x13
56392,Okay.,Dwight,Season 9,9x13
56394,"Okay, this is an outrage. Ugh! You know what? This is Jim Halpert's home address, in case you guys wanna toilet paper his house or whatever.",Dwight,Season 9,9x13
56395,That seems inconsiderate.,Jim,Season 9,9x13
56397,"Guys, it wasn't up to me. Rolf, come on. Guys, it wasn't my choice! I would have hired all of you! Gabor, Gabor.",Dwight,Season 9,9x13

56437,Aah!,Dwight,Season 9,9x13
56438,"No, it does matter who ends up sitting next to Pam when I'm gone. The people around you are basically who you end up spending your life with. I mean, because of where my desk was, I spent all those years looking at Pam, and I fell in love. So, that stuff matters. Definitely does.",Jim,Season 9,9x13
56449,"I've really been putting in the hours on this mural. And my boss is totally OK with it, because he's in the Bahamas and has no clue what anybody is doing. I'm usually very self-critical. I hate what I paint. But, I don't know, this time I feel like it's, um, it's really coming together... [sees mural] Oh my god! [camera pans to mural with butts painted over it] Wha? You've gotta be kidding me! What it... are those... are those butts? [to warehouse crew] Huh? No way. No way!",Pam,Season 9,9x14

It's my choice.",Pam,Season 9,9x14
56472,"I don't demand justice often. I'm not like Angela, who calls a lawyer every time someone watches a YouTube video of animals doing it. But, someone should get fired over this, right? Val's no help. Andy's gone. Jim's out. I just feel like I'm on my own here. [boom microphone bumps her head, she smiles] I mean, OK, not completely on my own. But, in terms of people who can do something. Thank you, Brian.",Pam,Season 9,9x14

56494,Yes. Thank you. Let's answer that question.,Pam,Season 9,9x14
56496,What? Come on guys. We need to figure out who did this and punish them. This isn't just about me. This is about all of us. This is our mural. Don't you see? How much we worked on this? How much time and energy? We put our heart and soul into this thing.,Pam,Season 9,9x14
56498,"Sure did. I was as surprised as you, but apparently, he is very passionate about public art.",Pam,Season 9,9x14

56507,Great.,Pam,Season 9,9x14

56530,We just need a pretense to talk to him. We could tell him that his mother is dying. That usually works on him. [holds up phone] Nate. Your mother is dying. [Nate reacts with grief],Dwight,Season 9,9x14
56531,"See, I feel bad about that.",Pam,Season 9,9x14
56532,It's all right. It's all right.,Dwight,Season 9,9x14

56581,I'm saying we should go scorched earth on that guy's face.,Pam,Season 9,9x14
56582,"Normally, I find Pam to be a comforting, if unarousing, presence around the office. Like a well-watered fern. But, today, she has tapped into this vengeful, violent side. And I'm like, wow, Pam has kind of a good butt.",Dwight,Season 9,9x14

56603,[after Darryl eyes him drinking from a thermos] It's mine. Don't worry.,Jim,Season 9,9x14
56605,I don't think you had to.,Jim,Season 9,9x14
56607,"I think you might be going a little crazy with this labeling thing, man. I mean, you put your name on a five pound bag of flour. Are you honestly saying that if I needed flour I couldn't use that?",Jim,Season 9,9x14
56609,That's not the point.,Jim,Season 9,9x14
56611,"No, I'm not making bread.",Jim,Season 9,9x14
56613,"Darryl, it doesn't matter. I think you know the point I'm trying to make.",Jim,Season 9,9x14
56615,It's all good. Are we all good?,Jim,Season 9,9x14
56617,What's that cooler?,Jim,Season 9,9x14
56619,"Oh, crap. Were those yours?",Jim,Season 9,9x14
56620,[pulling Clark across the parking lot] I never want to see you working in the upstairs office again. Do you hear me?,Dwight,Season 9,9x14
56622,"Silence. You'll now be working in the warehouse with the untouchables. Now, go make your hands rough with work.",Dwight,Season 9,9x14
56624,"Shh, shh.",Pam,Season 9,9x14
56626,Shh. Remember your lines.,Pam,Season 9,9x14
56628,Go move some paper!,Dwight,Season 9,9x14
56629,"[to Darryl on phone] Hey, you know that guy Frank who works in the warehouse?",Pam,Season 9,9x14
56631,OK. What does he like? What's important to him? Does he have like a favorite pair of boots or a lunch box or...,Pam,Season 9,9x14
56633,"Yeah, something like that.",Pam,Season 9,9x14
56635,"Oh, great! [to Dwight] His truck!",Pam,Season 9,9x14
56636,Great. Get the plate number.,Dwight,Season 9,9x14
56637,OK. [to Darryl] Do you know the plate... never mind. Why would you know that? And why would I be asking that?,Pam,Season 9,9x14
56638,So we know which truck to van...,Dwight,Season 9,9x14
56640,Yeah. I was kinda hoping you could. I gotta go. Bye. [to Dwight] Come on. [camera pans to Clark duct taped to a chair],Pam,Season 9,9x14
56653,I'm done. What are you... Is that supposed to be my mural?,Pam,Season 9,9x14
56654,"Yeah. Frank draws a butt on your mural, I'm drawing your mural on Frank's truck's butt. Eye for an eye, mamacita.",Dwight,Season 9,9x14
56655,"Aw, Dwight. That's really sweet.",Pam,Season 9,9x14
56656,Let's see yours.,Dwight,Season 9,9x14
56657,"Oh, no. Um, I, I'm embarrassed. It's stupid.",Pam,Season 9,9x14
56658,This is amazing! Frank! And he's leaving a trail of poops?,Dwight,Season 9,9x14
56659,Yeah. And he has saggy boobs.,Pam,Season 9,9x14
56660,I saw that. That's great!,Dwight,Season 9,9x14
56661,Yeah. I feel better.,Pam,Season 9,9x14
56662,"Good. I'm glad you feel better. This has been a wonderful day. I have to say, I like hanging out with a vengeful bitch.",Dwight,Season 9,9x14
56663,"I know. You miss Angela, don't you?",Pam,Season 9,9x14
56664,Ugh! Don't sympathize. You're ruining the mood. Back to work. Draw his penis.,Dwight,Season 9,9x14
56665,"I got back at Frank in the most fitting way possible. With my art. The paints are water-based. It's gonna come off with a hose. But, I think the lesson will last a very...",Pam,Season 9,9x14
56667,"No, you had no right!",Pam,Season 9,9x14
56669,So? You started it!,Pam,Season 9,9x14
56672,Whoa.,Pam,Season 9,9x14
56683,"Well, I'm gonna say something to the producers.",Pam,Season 9,9x14
56685,"You shouldn't be fired. I mean, you were just protecting me.",Pam,Season 9,9x14
56687,Forget about my mural. It's stupid.,Pam,Season 9,9x14
56689,"It's crazy. Brian, I'm so sorry.",Pam,Season 9,9x14
56691,"Thanks, Brian.",Pam,Season 9,9x14
56693,"Wow. This whole Philly thing has been so much fun that I may have lost sight of what really matters. I mean, having fun is not nearly as important as being good to the people who you really care about. I mean, that's just 'Roommates 101'.",Jim,Season 9,9x14
56695,Oh. Oh!,Jim,Season 9,9x14
56697,[imitating game announcer] You win. [Darryl throws empty can on floor] How good did that feel?,Jim,Season 9,9x14
56699,[to Jim] Hey. I feel so lucky we're in the same city for Valentine's Day.,Pam,Season 9,9x15
56700,"It's like magic. Or, it's like me getting on my hands and knees and begging my partners to switch a Tuesday for a Thursday.",Jim,Season 9,9x15
56701,[makes magic trick hand gesture] Alakazam!,Pam,Season 9,9x15
56702,"By the way, they do need an extra day next week.",Jim,Season 9,9x15
56703,"And, poof! He disappears. [Jim snaps, playing along]",Pam,Season 9,9x15
56714,"[knocks on Andy's door, then pretends to answer as Andy] Come in.",Dwight,Season 9,9x15
56715,"[talking to Andy's empty chair] Andy, hi. I just made another huge sale for the company that you manage. I need you to authorize that expense report and sign off on that contract.",Dwight,Season 9,9x15
56716,"[pretending to be Andy] I would be happy to. It would be my pleasure, Mr. Schrute. Rick-a-dick-doo, rick-a-dick-dick-dick, rick-a-dick-doo.",Dwight,Season 9,9x15
56717,"I really like Andy these days. He's pretend and he does exactly as I tell him to. All that will change when real Andy comes back tomorrow. [thinks for a moment] Unless he comes back as pretend Dwight. In which case, we're in for an epic, confusing showdown.",Dwight,Season 9,9x15
56733,[eating] These are gross.,Pam,Season 9,9x15
56734,They are terrible.,Jim,Season 9,9x15
56735,"Oh, hey, don't fill up on chocolates. I made us a lunch reservation at State Street Grill.",Pam,Season 9,9x15
56736,Oh my god. That's so romantic.,Jim,Season 9,9x15
56737,It's with Brian and Alyssa.,Pam,Season 9,9x15
56738,Oh my god. That's less romantic.,Jim,Season 9,9x15
56739,"I know. But we should go. We need to thank him for, you know, saving my life.",Pam,Season 9,9x15
56740,"Yeah, yeah. No, totally. That's good. So, should we just get a bottle of wine later and celebrate?",Jim,Season 9,9x15
56741,That sounds nice.,Pam,Season 9,9x15
56742,"I'm very excited to see Brian. Brian's a great guy. And Pam and I have gotten really close to he and his wife, Alyssa over the years. And he got fired for protecting my wife from a jerk in the warehouse. I'm sorry, but you know him. He's a good guy.",Jim,Season 9,9x15
56758,"[enters restaurant with Pam] Hey, Brian.",Jim,Season 9,9x15
56760,Sorry we're late.,Pam,Season 9,9x15
56762,"Ha,ha,ha, yeah OK.",Pam,Season 9,9x15
56763,What?,Jim,Season 9,9x15
56764,He's on a no carb thing. Supposedly.,Pam,Season 9,9x15
56765,Oh.,Jim,Season 9,9x15
56767,Yeah.,Pam,Season 9,9x15
56768,"Are you kidding? Thank you, man. I mean, I've wanted the opportunity to say thanks for... everything. And I'm really sorry about the job. That just seems crazy.",Jim,Season 9,9x15
56770,"Well, my dad can't hear a thing. You could boom his whole life for him.",Pam,Season 9,9x15
56772,Where's Alyssa?,Pam,Season 9,9x15
56774,Oh.,Pam,Season 9,9x15
56776,[to Andy's empty chair] I have yet another sales order for you to sign.,Dwight,Season 9,9x15
56777,[acting as Andy] Why thank you Mr. Schrute. I don't know how you do it. You're a god. Rick-a-dick-dick-doo.,Dwight,Season 9,9x15
56779,You're back. [surveys Andy] And you're disgusting.,Dwight,Season 9,9x15
56792,"Hey, Burning Man, if it's not selling out too much, you might want to throw on a tie. David Wallace is gonna be here in an hour.",Dwight,Season 9,9x15
56795,"No. Please. Come on, Clark. Wallace knows that he's been gone for the last three months. [Andy stalls] Right? Wallace does know that you've been gone for the last three months?",Dwight,Season 9,9x15
56804,"Well, I mean, that's OK. It doesn't mean that it's over. Right? I mean, couples fight.",Jim,Season 9,9x15
56806,[obviously flustered] Yeah.,Pam,Season 9,9x15
56807,What?,Jim,Season 9,9x15
56809,Crying?,Jim,Season 9,9x15
56811,Thank you.,Dwight,Season 9,9x15
56813,Yes!,Dwight,Season 9,9x15
56815,[laughing together] Yeah!,Dwight,Season 9,9x15
56817,You were on a boat.,Dwight,Season 9,9x15
56819,On a boat.,Dwight,Season 9,9x15
56821,In the ocean.,Dwight,Season 9,9x15
56823,I'm not gonna say it.,Dwight,Season 9,9x15
56825,Not a word.,Dwight,Season 9,9x15
56827,No! [Andy makes a call] What do you think you're doing?,Dwight,Season 9,9x15
56829,Don't you dare! Andy!,Dwight,Season 9,9x15
56837,[whispers] Coolio.,Dwight,Season 9,9x15
56839,Coolio. Coolio.,Dwight,Season 9,9x15
56842,Coolio.,Dwight,Season 9,9x15
56845,"No, Jan! Please do not listen to this boob! Remember Clark. He gave you everything. Everything.",Dwight,Season 9,9x15
56849,"Please Ja, Ja... [Jan hangs up]",Dwight,Season 9,9x15
56860,Two seconds of the turd dog and he loses the biggest sale this branch has ever seen.,Dwight,Season 9,9x15
56863,"God! I just don't know what we'd do. I mean, short of telling David Wallace that he was gone for three months.",Dwight,Season 9,9x15
56864,"I'd like to rat out Andy. Unfortunately, I have a bit of a boy-who-cried-wolf dynamic with David Wallace. Except, instead of a boy, I'm a man. And instead of a wolf, I cried genetically-engineered monster wolf.",Dwight,Season 9,9x15
56870,"Fine! The state he's in, Wallace will take one look at him and probably fire him anyway.",Dwight,Season 9,9x15
56872,"OK, I can tell you're mad at me. Do you wanna just, um, I don't know, tell me why?",Pam,Season 9,9x15
56873,"I don't know. I thought that was a little weird. You told me Brian got fired for the whole warehouse thing. And you intentionally left out a kind of major, intimate detail. I don't know, Pam, I guess I just feel like a chump. Who knows less about his marriage than the sound guy.",Jim,Season 9,9x15
56874,I didn't tell you about the crying because I didn't want you to know how upset I was. Because it would've stressed you out and you're always saying how much you don't want more stress.,Pam,Season 9,9x15
56875,"Yeah, well. Yeah, OK. Well, then thank you. Thanks to both of you.",Jim,Season 9,9x15
56876,It's not Brian's fault.,Pam,Season 9,9x15
56877,"No, you're right. And, and I'm not mad at Brian. And to be honest, I probably don't have any reason to be mad at all because I wasn't there. So, let's just forget about it.",Jim,Season 9,9x15
56878,OK.,Pam,Season 9,9x15
56880,"Well, we had the Scranton White Pages.",Dwight,Season 9,9x15
56891,[interrupting] ' lit the whole thing on fire. It was crazy.,Dwight,Season 9,9x15
56893,Yeah.,Dwight,Season 9,9x15
56895,The whole thing is in ashes. Fire department was here. It was in all the papers.,Dwight,Season 9,9x15
56934,You know what? Maybe we should cancel that bottle of wine tonight.,Jim,Season 9,9x15
56935,Oh?,Pam,Season 9,9x15
56936,"Yeah. I just feel like I got a bunch of stuff to do in Philly and I'm sure you have stuff to do. So we can just... I don't know, drop me at the bus station?",Jim,Season 9,9x15
56937,Are you sure?,Pam,Season 9,9x15
56938,I just feel like we're gonna fight.,Jim,Season 9,9x15
56939,[obviously hurt] Yeah.,Pam,Season 9,9x15
56940,So... how 'bout let's not?,Jim,Season 9,9x15

56945,Thank you.,Pam,Season 9,9x15
56946,No problem.,Jim,Season 9,9x15
56947,I don't think you should go to Philly tonight. I think that you should stay and I think we should fight.,Pam,Season 9,9x15
56948,You really wanna fight on Valentine's Day?,Jim,Season 9,9x15
56949,"Yeah, I do.",Pam,Season 9,9x15
56950,"OK. All right, put your dukes up, Beesly.",Jim,Season 9,9x15
56996,He sounds like a wounded animal.,Pam,Season 9,9x16
57000,Ok. [Andy continues moaning],Pam,Season 9,9x16
57002,"[taking paper from Kevin] Oh that's mine! Um, I'll just, I'll get it out of the way for you.",Pam,Season 9,9x16
57003,"Jim set up a job interview for me today in Philly. It's um, with a real estate company, which is a great fit for me because I live in a house and I know what a bathroom is. [laughs] I'm sorry, I am just very nervous because honestly this is all moving a lot faster than I expected. And, and because my resume can fit on a post-it note.",Pam,Season 9,9x16
57004,"[on phone] No, don't just let her eat the grass, she'll puke it right up. OK, just put out two bowls and see which feed she prefers. I'm sorry to be taking up so much of your precious time, Mose, but she's your aunt too. Fine. I'll see what I can do.",Dwight,Season 9,9x16
57005,[Jumps out from behind vending machine] I need you.,Dwight,Season 9,9x16

57009,"It's my aunt Shirley, she's on her last legs.",Dwight,Season 9,9x16
57011,"You have no idea. I mean her hair, clothes, it's all falling off in great big clumps. And we need someone to go out there and clean her up. We had a nurse, but she quit because she was 'poisoned' by Aunt Shirley.",Dwight,Season 9,9x16
57013,"Probably nothing, or strychnine. Or lemonade and strychnine. Which is actually what it was.",Dwight,Season 9,9x16
57015,Thank you.,Dwight,Season 9,9x16
57017,"Angela. You owe me one, remember? Now please, she's an old woman Angela. She needs a woman's touch. It's all hanging out-",Dwight,Season 9,9x16
57019,And there's parts of her I don't even recognize.,Dwight,Season 9,9x16
57021,"There's this one hanging part in particular, that's some sort of flap.",Dwight,Season 9,9x16
57023,"It's like a prehensile wing or something, you know?",Dwight,Season 9,9x16

57551,"So, let's get it going.",Dwight,Season 9,9x17
57554,"We Schrutes don't need some Harvard doctor to tell us who's alive and who's dead. But, there was an unlucky streak of burying some heavy sleepers.

57604,Oui.,Dwight,Season 9,9x17
57606,"[while everyone is gathered playing and singing 'Sons & Daughters'] People underestimate the power of nostalgia. If baseball can use it to get people to care about that worthless sport, then I can use it to get my siblings to care about the farm. Nostalgia is truly one of the great human weaknesses.

57637,Did you just ask me if this was a cow?,Dwight,Season 9,9x17
57639,Come here. Come on. Grab a teat with each hand. Sit down. There you go. Squeeze from top to bottom. Really pull. Use some muscle. Draw the milk out. All right. Going all right?,Dwight,Season 9,9x17

59639,It was nothing personal. It's just that you were terrible at your job.,Dwight,Season 9,9x23

59682,[pause] I'm sorry. Is there a question?,Pam,Season 9,9x23
59685,"Oh, um, well, you know, I' I just' I just think I would rather keep that private. You know, if you'd been filmed for nine years of your life, there'd be some things that you just wanna keep to yourself.",Pam,Season 9,9x23
59693,"Um, you know what, I actually didn't handle that move, uh, very gracefully. From not communicating to being a little selfish.",Jim,Season 9,9x23
59694,"Listen, um' I was scared, you know? I loved what I had, and I didn't want to risk it. And I think that maybe I did doubt him a little too. Which was wrong because he's shown me time and again. But when the documentary started airing, people on the street told me that I had this fairy-tale romance. But there were a lot of times last year where it did not feel like a fairy tale. But then it got deeper, and it got stronger and now it's better than a fairy tale. It's like a long book that you never want to end.  And you're fine with that because you just never, ever wanna leave it.",Pam,Season 9,9x23
59696,"Yeah, like Harry Potter.",Pam,Season 9,9x23

So a year ago, I got my first art commission to paint a mural for Dunder Mifflin and I decided to paint the history of paper',which was just some trees and stuff. And then someone spray painted a bunch of butts on it and I had to start from the beginning.

It's just hard to accept that I spent so many years being less happy than I could have been. Jim was 5 feet from my desk and it took me four years to get to him. It'd be great if people saw this documentary and learned from my mistakes. Not that I'm a tragic person. I'm really happy now. But'it would just'just make my heart soar if someone out there saw this and she said to herself 'be strong, trust yourself, love yourself. Conquer your fears. Just go after what you want and act fast, because life just isn't that long.'",Pam,Season 9,9x23
